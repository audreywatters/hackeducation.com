<p>I&#8217;m making some major changes to Hack Education this year &#8211; and no, not because I&#8217;ve received venture capital and my investors have told me I have to rewrite the publication&#8217;s mission statement again. That&#8217;s a different site you&#8217;re thinking of&#8230;</p>

<p>For a good portion of the year, Hack Education will go dormant. I&#8217;m no longer going to write the Friday &#8220;Hack Education Weekly News,&#8221; the list of all the education, technology, and ed-tech updates from each week. I&#8217;m ending that series because I&#8217;m no longer going to write my lengthy series on the year-in-review either. Not in 2019 at least, as I must focus on <em><a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a></em> (the draft is due in April and the final manuscript due in September). </p>

<p>Once the book is done, I plan to write weekly (or so) essays analyzing what&#8217;s going on in education and technology. Many of these will be historical, since it seems that so many people who work in ed-tech are utterly ignorant (even purposefully ignorant) of the field&#8217;s rich history. I do plan to continue keeping a close eye on some of the powerful <a href="http://network.hackeducation.com">networks of entrepreneurs and investors</a> &#8211; work that will extend some of what I undertook as a Spencer Fellow, work that includes tracking <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">who&#8217;s funding ed-tech companies</a> (and the <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/edsurge.html">stories that are being spun about the future</a>). And some weeks, no doubt, I&#8217;ll respond to whatever golden egg the industry trumpets that it has laid. </p>

<p>But mostly I want the work I do here on Hack Education to be less reactive to the bad stuff that gets regularly trotted out as &#8220;innovation.&#8221; The way we get better and smarter will not be through ed-tech&#8217;s marketers and hucksters. I am hoping that the shift away from compiling all the goings-on for that weekly news article will give me more time to think deeply and critically about education and technology, instead of always feelings overwhelmed and enraged and disappointed by how many terrible and silly things are being marketed as &#8220;solutions&#8221; by people who just want to sell us a product or service or (more often than not) a load of bullshit. </p>

<p>This site will remain vulture free. No investors, philanthropists, sponsors, or advertisers. Just pigeons.</p>
