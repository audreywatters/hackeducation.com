<p>I am always suspicious when I hear people invoke "objectivity" -- whether they're scientists or journalists or teachers. I am deeply implicated -- me, Audrey -- in all I write, in all I think. I try my best to be transparent about that. So here's some things that situate my knowledge (and for you, dear reader, to situate me in turn):</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I went to public school in Wyoming through 11th grade when I attended a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stclares.ac.uk/">private boarding school</a>&nbsp;in Oxford, England. (My dad's from Wyoming; my mom's from England.) I did not graduate from high school. (The State of Wyoming would not grant me my diploma as I didn't have enough PE credits.) I have an International Baccalaureate instead. The IB was the best education I received in my entire educational career: from kindergarten through graduate school. &nbsp;I recognize the privilege of private school.</p>
<p>I dropped out of college when I was 19. I had a baby when I was 21. I went back to school eventually and stayed there for multiple degrees. I was widowed when I was 34. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/08/29/the-real-reason-i-dropped-out-of-a-phd-program/">I dropped out of a PhD program a year later</a>.</p>
<p>I taught university for almost 10 years. I taught a variety of classes in a number of departments: composition, Folklore, Women's Studies, English, Film, Comparative Literature. During that time, I was a member of the&nbsp;<a href="http://gtff.net/">Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation</a>, the labor union representing the University of Oregon graduate students and a local of the American Federation of Teachers. I am no longer a member of either union, as I'm no longer a grad student.</p>
<p>I wrote my Masters Thesis in Folklore on political pranks. This included a chapter on political pie-throwing. Yes, I remain a rabble-rouser. Yes, I laugh at this stuff. Yes, I think it's important.</p>
<p>I worked for the&nbsp;<a href="http://iste.org/">International Society for Technology in Education</a>&nbsp;for (not quite) two years before resigning to become a freelance writer. I have no financial interest in the organization and am not a member.</p>
<p>I have a 21-year-old son who's opted not to go to college. I don't believe that everyone should go to college; I think that things are incredibly tough for those who don't.</p>
<h2>Economics</h2>
<p>I have freelanced for various education-related publications, including <a href="http://modernlearners.com">Educating Modern Learners</a>, <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org">KQED MindShift</a>, <a href="http://insidehighered.com">Inside Higher Ed</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/author/awatters/">The School Library Journal</a>.</p>
<p>Mostly I write for my own ed-tech blog&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Hack Education</a>. I refuse to run ads or take sponsorship dollars. Instead, the site is funded by readers' <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/support.php">donations</a>.)</p>
<p>I've also done some <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/02/06/teaching-web-building-to-everybody/">research</a> to pay my bills. &nbsp;I've done some <a href="http://speaking.hackeducation.com">speaking</a>. I won't do consulting. I hold no stocks in any company. The only investing I do is via crowdfunding. (Does that count? I dunno...)</p>
<p>I am the recipient of a <a href="https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/">Shuttleworth Foundation Flash Grant</a>, which supports my "open thinking" on Hack Education.</p>
<p>My partner&nbsp;<a href="http://kinlane.com/">Kin Lane</a>&nbsp;is also a technology professional, and we've started a business together called <a href="http://techgypsi.es">Techgypsies</a>. The name pretty much says it all. When people ask where we live, I say "out of a suitcase." &nbsp;I should add "hopefully near free WiFi and a power source," but always in motion.</p>
