<p>I'm headed to <a href="http://www.isteconference.org/">ISTE</a> at the end of June, and as happens with any event I register to attend as press, the flood of briefing requests from exhibitors has started.</p>
<p>I don't want to respond snarkily.  Mostly, I don't respond, period.  I'm sorry, I really don't mean to be rude.  But the fact of the matter is, I'm attending ISTE primarily to talk to educators, not just to talk to education technology companies.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong.  If you have a <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/04/19/headed-to-iste-2011-come-party-with-learnboost-and-me/">special event</a> or announcement, I'll try to tune in.  Looking through the exhibitor list, there are definitely companies and organizations I want to talk to.  And no doubt, I'll spend plenty of time on the showroom floor.  Such is the nature of the ISTE conference.</p>
<p>(Funnily enough, even though this'll be my 8th ISTE conference, it'll be the first that I've actually <em>attended</em> and not <em>worked</em> -- although I guess technically I'm still working at this one, just not <em>for</em> the conference organizers.  And I confess, I've got a bit of the case of newbie nervousness, looking at the vast program and wondering which sessions I should attend.)</p>
<p>So you'll find me in the exhibits hall.  But you'll also find me at the Robotics Playground.  You'll find me at the Bloggers Cafe.</p>
<p>So keep the pitches coming.  Please do.  I do want to make sure there's actually <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/07/05/tech-industry-blogs-iste-2010-the-coverage-that-wasnt/">news coverage</a> this year.  But if you pitch me, <strong>give me the best time to stop by your booth</strong> or <strong>give me some hint (I do honor embargoes) as to special news you'll be announcing</strong>.</p>
