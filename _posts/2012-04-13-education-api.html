<p>When I was a tech blogger for <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a> and API-related news broke, we writers would often shudder. &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t use API in the headline,&rdquo; the argument in the newsroom went. It&rsquo;s the page-view-kiss-of-death. That&rsquo;s not because APIs aren&rsquo;t super-important or super-ubiquitous on the Web (they are both). It&rsquo;s because most &ldquo;<a href="http://cdixon.org/2010/01/22/techies-and-normals/">normals</a>&rdquo; don&rsquo;t know what they are or why they matter. They&rsquo;d rather click on a story that says &ldquo;101 Ways to Use Pinterest to Plan Your Wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision to cover APIs regularly on ReadWriteWeb and eschew stories that fall into the &ldquo;[Number] Ways to Use [Hot New Social Media Tool] to [Conduct a Seasonally-Relevant Activity]&rdquo; goes a long way to explain the popularity of RWW versus that of Mashable, incidentally.</p>
<p>Also incidentally: Pinterest <a href="http://tijn.bo.lt/pinterest-api">has an API</a>.</p>
<p>This all presents a bit of a challenge, of course, if I want to make an argument for my readers here about why APIs really matter in education. Do I frame the argument for &ldquo;normals&rdquo;? (Wait! HA! &ldquo;Normals&rdquo; don&rsquo;t read Hack Education!) Do I frame it for educators? Entrepreneurs? Technologists? The answer: hopefully all of the above.</p>
<h2 id="whatisanapi">What is an API?</h2>
<p>API stands for &ldquo;Application Programming Interface.&rdquo; At its most basic level, an API allows one app to talk to another app. It&rsquo;s the way in which Web and mobile technologies can open up their data and their software&rsquo;s functionality to others. It&rsquo;s how Zynga integrates its games with your Facebook profile. It&rsquo;s how websites handle accepting payments via Paypal and play YouTube videos. It&rsquo;s how Instagram can share your photos to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Tumblr.</p>
<p>Rather than having to export a file from one system, then import it into another, APIs allow programs to &ldquo;make calls,&rdquo; sending and receiving just the information they need just when they need it. Web APIs (also known as REST APIs) do this &ndash; well obviously &ndash; via the Web using the protocols of the Web (HTTP). But instead of returning HTML like a website does when you &ldquo;call&rdquo; it, Web APIs return XML or JSON &ndash; that is, machine-readable data that other apps and websites can make us of.</p>
<p>But enough with the tech&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="whydoesthismatterineducation">Why does this matter in education?</h2>
<p>Educational data is <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/04/11/download-all-your-education-data-with-the-click-of-one-button/">stuck in silos</a>, something fostered by educational software &ndash; administrative and instructional &ndash; that makes it cumbersome at best and impossible at worst to move data in and out of systems. As a result, there&rsquo;s lots of extra clerical work that educators and administrators have to do &ndash; recreating rosters, copying grades, downloading CSVs, copying-and-pasting, and so on. All because educational apps and software do not, as a rule, talk to one another.</p>
<p>Student Information Systems don&rsquo;t know which level of Angry Birds students are on. (Um hello, don&rsquo;t laugh: <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/04/another-gravitational-experiment-in-angry-birds-space/">Angry Birds is science</a>!) A better example, perhaps: a school&rsquo;s SIS might not talk to the district&rsquo;s database or the state&rsquo;s records system. Parents probably don&rsquo;t get an automatic SMS when there&rsquo;s an attendance issue or library book due. Learning management systems don&rsquo;t automatically capture what or how far students have read in their e-readers or what they&rsquo;ve annotated.</p>
<p>These functionalities (and lots more) are possible when there are APIs, opening the door to all sorts of <em>real-time</em> connections between products, services, and systems that are currently impossible due to time constraints, burdensome download and data entry processes, and vendors who&rsquo;d prefer to maintain data lock-in.</p>

<h2 id="wherearetheeduapis">Where are the EDU APIs?</h2>
<p>The absence of APIs from a lot of education applications, I&rsquo;d argue, is a good indication that we&rsquo;re still dealing in many cases with pre-Web era technologies (or at least a pre-Web era mindframe). Student information systems. Learning management systems. Educational software for your desktop computer. All pre-Web. And even newer versions of these older systems often carry forward this legacy of a world without Web (or hell, even Internet) connectivity.</p>
<p>APIs played a crucial part in the explosion of Web technologies. E-commerce. Social networking. Cloud computing. Now mobile computing. All facilitated by APIs. APIs have enabled companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Twitter to become <em>platforms</em>, allowing other developers to build on top of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Platforms&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t necessarily something we talk about in education, although they do exist and are being developed <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/10/13/the-race-to-platform-education/">with increasing frequency</a>. Google Apps for Education is certainly an example of one. <a href="http://edmodo.com">Edmodo</a> is attempting to carve a similar path, and with the release its API last month, I described the startup as making the move &ldquo;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/03/06/edmodo-makes-the-move-from-social-network-to-education-platform/">from social network to education platform</a>.&rdquo; Edmodo&rsquo;s and Google&rsquo;s APIs allows other companies &ndash; <a href="http://mathalicious.com">Mathalicious</a>, <a href="http://desmos.com">Desmos</a>, <a href="http://aviary.com">Aviary</a>, for example &ndash; to connect their apps to these platforms, tapping into rosters, roles, feeds, assignments, calendars, documents and so on.</p>
<p>The LMS could be a platform too, I suppose &ndash; <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/">and with APIs, that&rsquo;s the direction it could go</a>. But what&rsquo;s interesting to me is that, with their origins in a pre Web 2.0 world, LMSes have devised a separate standard to offer connections to external modules &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/">LTI</a>,&rdquo; not API. Is there widespread interest among third-party developers to integrate with LMSes via LTI? (To make the process simpler, <a href="https://lti-examples.heroku.com/index.html">Instructure co-founder Brian Whitmer has created a site</a> with examples and code samples.) Or will the pervasiveness of Web APIs mean that developers' interest goes elsewhere?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m veering dangerously back into the technical realm here &ndash; the type of discussions that, as I started this post, tend to make &ldquo;normals&rdquo; not read and not care about APIs.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re incredibly important, why we should pay attention to them in education, and why I recommend having an API is something you should look for in the tools you adopt: APIs make data accessible. APIs foster interoperability. APIs extend functionality. And APIs create an ecosystem -- of technology, of developers, of users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We want that for ed-tech, don't we?</p>

<p><em>Disclosure: My boyfriend <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> is the &ldquo;<a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>,&rdquo; helping companies think through their API strategies, build their APIs, and support their developers &ndash; both internally and externally. So when I talk about the importance of APIs, I should note not just what they afford education but what they afford me. (As in, being an API evangelist than being an ed-tech writer). Thanks APIs!</em></p>
