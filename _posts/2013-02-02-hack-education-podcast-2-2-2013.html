<p>2013 is off to a bit of a crazy start, and despite our best intentions to record this podcast weekly, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I simply haven't been able to do so. That means that when we finally have a chance to sit down and chat, as we did today, we have a lot to catch up on and talk about.</p>
<p>But we managed this week just to focus on&nbsp;<a href="/2013/01/23/a-bill-of-rights-and-principles-for-learning-in-the-digital-age/">The Learners' Bill of Rights</a>. We had a great discussion about it, in which we talked about the origins and the promise and the flaws and the biases and the ongoing conversations about the document.</p>
