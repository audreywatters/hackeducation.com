<p><em><a href="http://blogs.slj.com/afuse8production/2014/07/02/press-release-obituary-walter-dean-myers-1937-2014/">RIP Walter Dean Myers</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/opinion/sunday/where-are-the-people-of-color-in-childrens-books.html">His op-ed</a> earlier this year on the lack of diversity in children's books)</em></p>
<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p>The <strong>US Supreme Court</strong> ruled in <em>Harris v Quinn</em> that a group of home health workers do not have to pay union dues if they don&rsquo;t want to. Teachers&rsquo; <strong>collective bargaining</strong> rights will not be immediately impacted, <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/07/01/unions-dodge-bullet-supreme-court-ruling">say some observers</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Supreme Cour</strong>t also <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/2014/07/03/622f7b12-02f8-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322_story.html">issued</a> an unsigned opinion, saying that <strong>Wheaton College</strong>, a Christian college in Illinois, does not have to fill out the form to opt out of the <strong>Affordable Care Act</strong>&rsquo;s mandates surrounding birth control. The opinion comes on the heels of the Court&rsquo;s decision in <strong><em>Burwell v Hobby Lobby</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>New York Court of Appeals</strong> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/new-york-court-strikes-down-cyberbullying-law-1404239912">struck down</a> an Albany County law that had made <strong>cyberbullying</strong> a crime, ruling that the law violated the <strong>First Amendment</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Interest rates</strong> on <strong>student loans</strong> have <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2014/06/30/student-loan-interest-rates-to-increase">gone up</a>. Thanks, Congress.</p>
<p>The <strong>Oklahoma Board of Education</strong> has <a href="http://newsok.com/oklahoma-board-of-education-terminates-contract-with-controversial-testing-vendor/article/4972784">terminated</a> its contract with testing vendor <strong>CTB/McGraw Hill</strong> after the state experienced problems with online assessments for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>The <strong>New Mexico</strong> purchasing office has <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2014/07/New_Mexico_rejects_protest_of.html">dismissed</a> the protest filed by the American Institutes for Research that charged that the bidding process for the <strong>PARCC</strong> assessment contract (a contract won by Pearson) was unfair.</p>
<p>Despite initially supporting efforts to require schools offer healthier lunches, the <strong>School Nutrition Association</strong> is now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/us/nutrition-group-lobbies-against-healthier-school-meals-it-sought-citing-cost.html">lobbying</a> to allow schools to opt out of new nutritional requirements.</p>
<p><strong>General Assembly</strong>, <strong>Codecademy</strong>, <strong>CodeCombat</strong>, and <strong>OpenCurriculum</strong> <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/ed-tech-companies-oppose-u-s-agencys-plan-to-end-net-neutrality/53687">issued a joint press release</a> outlining their opposition to the <strong>FCC</strong>&rsquo;s plans to end <strong>net neutrality</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/fccs-e-rate-proposal-aims-to-close-the-wi-fi-gap-in-us-schools-and-libraries/">Alex Howard opens his article</a> on the <strong>FCC&rsquo;</strong>s proposed changes to <strong>E-Rate</strong> with his ability to watch the World Cup online while at his vacation home in Maine. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s the right way to frame the issue of <strong>rural access to WiFi</strong>. Folks live and work and attend school in rural areas, not only vacation there. But once he gets into the heart of the issue, Howard&rsquo;s article does a great job of explaining the costs of upgrading school and library infrastructure, as well as some of the concerns about the sustainability of the E-Rate program. And he certainly avoids framing the issue with the dismissive language that <a href="http://recode.net/2014/07/01/fcc-defends-school-wi-fi-plan-as-teachers-unions-complain/">another technology blog does</a>: &ldquo;FCC Defends School Wi-Fi Plan as Teachers Unions Complain.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Great LAUSD iPad Clusterf**k Continues</h2>
<p><strong>LAUSD</strong> will allow 27 of its high schools to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-laptops-20140630-story.html">buy laptop computers instead of <strong>iPads</strong></a>. The new devices will cost $40 million. (That&rsquo;s in addition to the $30 million contract the district signed with Apple last year. The entire cost of the project &ndash; to equip every student in the district with an iPad&hellip; computing device: $1 billion.)</p>
<h2>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Two words are wrong in &lsquo;MOOC&rsquo;: Massive and open,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/07/02/why-udacity-ceo-sebastianthrun-is-rolling-out.html?page=all">says Stanford President John Hennessy</a> (in an article on <strong>Udacity</strong>&rsquo;s nanodegrees), to which <strong>George Siemens</strong> had <a href="https://twitter.com/gsiemens/status/484386975940894720">the perfect response</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Marginal Revolution University</strong>&rsquo;s goal, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/online-upstarts-goal-mooc-lectures-that-go-viral/53539">reads The Chronicle of Higher Education headline</a>: &ldquo;MOOC Lectures That Go Viral&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://ooed.org">Open Online Education</a></strong> launched this week, with a platform built using <strong>edX</strong>&rsquo;s open source tech. Classes are free; certificates are not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140626103112605">MOOCs in the developing world &ndash; Pros and cons</a>&rdquo;: "Unlike <strong>colonialism</strong>, Agarwal told the forum, MOOCs could boost human rights in some countries. &lsquo;The numbers are staggering,&rsquo; he said. &rsquo;I&rsquo;m really hard-pressed to understand how someone would say this is United States <strong>hegemony</strong>.&rsquo;&rdquo; Srsly?!</p>
<h2>Meanwhile on Campus</h2>
<p><strong>Arizona State University</strong> and the <strong>Thunderbird School of Global Management</strong> have reached a preliminary agreement <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/2014/07/03/asu-thunderbird-announce-plan-combine/12189185/">to merge</a>. (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303873604579491883020247524">Last year</a> the private non-profit business school tried to strike a partnership with the for-profit <strong>Laureate Education</strong> but that deal fell through.)</p>
<p><strong>ASU</strong> has placed on paid administrative leave the campus police officer who stopped professor <strong>Ersula Ore</strong> for jaywalking, violently throwing her to the ground then charging her with assault. The university says a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/07/03/arizona-state-officer-placed-leave">preliminary review</a>&rdquo; has found no evidence of racial profiling or excessive force. Hmmm.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/what-happens-when-a-prep-schools-black-student-president-moc">Buzzfeed tells the story</a> of <strong>Maya Peterson</strong> who was forced to step down as the student body president of <strong>The Lawrenceville School</strong>, after posting photos of herself to Instagram that were deemed to mock her white male classmates. Peterson was the first Black woman to hold the position at the prestigious prep school.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Education</strong> and <strong>Corinthian Colleges</strong> have <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/03/feds-and-corinthian-agree-plan-profits-closure-questions-remain">reached an agreement</a> over the closure and/or sale of the latter&rsquo;s schools.</p>

<p>The Chronicle of Higher Education <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/hackers-may-have-obtained-data-on-163000-at-butler-u/53675">reports</a> that a security breach at <strong>Butler University</strong> might have leaked the personal information of some 163,000 students, alumni, and employees.</p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong> announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/06/30Apple-Announces-Updates-to-iTunes-U.html">updates to <strong>iTunes U</strong></a>, coming July 8, which will allow course creation on the iPad (currently course creation is Web-only). Private iTunes U courses will now also have a discussion feature.</p>

<h2>Funding and Acquisitions</h2>
<p>Thanks in part to a <a href="https://twitter.com/levarburton/status/482276756460961793">$1 million donation</a> from Seth MacFarlane, the <strong>Reading Rainbow </strong>Kickstarter campaign ended, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/30/reading-rainbow-is-most-popular-kickstarter/">setting the record</a> for the most money raised on the crowdfunding platform: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/readingrainbow/bring-reading-rainbow-back-for-every-child-everywh">over $6 million</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Yik Yak</strong>, an anonymous messaging app aimed at colleges (which has been used for <strong><a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/04/gossip-app-brought-my-high-school-to-a-halt.html">cyberbullying</a></strong> already &ndash; no surprise), has raised $10 million in Series A funding from Azure Capital Partners, Renren Lianhe Holdings, and Tim Draper.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>PNAS</strong> has issued an &ldquo;<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/07/02/1412469111.full.pdf+html">editorial expression of concern</a>&rdquo; about the publication of the paper, detailing <strong>Facebook</strong>&rsquo;s psychological experiments. (The experiment and the furor over it are the topic for &ldquo;<a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-14/">What You Should Know This Week</a>&rdquo; over on Educating Modern Learners.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roughly 60 percent of K&ndash;12 officials surveyed by an industry group do not feel their schools have the <strong>bandwidth</strong> or <strong>devices</strong> to make them ready for summative, <strong>online testing</strong>,&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/06/survey_reveals_worries_about_s.html">reports EdWeek on a SIIA survey</a>.</p>
