<p>&#8220;The 7-year-old economic recovery has not been kind to the <strong>American public education system</strong>,&#8221; <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-recovery-hasnt-reached-americas-schools/">writes FiveThirtyEight</a>. &#8220;In May 2008, as the Great Recession was just beginning, U.S. school departments employed 8.4 million teachers and other workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This past May, they employed just 8.2 million &#8211; despite public-school enrollments that the Department of Education estimated have risen by more than 1 million students during the same period. Student-teacher ratios are as high as they&#8217;ve been since the late 1990s, though they&#8217;re still well below their levels of the 1980s and most of the 1990s.&#8221;</p>
