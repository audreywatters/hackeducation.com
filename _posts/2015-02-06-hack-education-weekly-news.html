<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p><strong>President Obama</strong> unveiled his <a href="m.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/agency-fact-sheets"><strong>budget</strong></a> this week. (<a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data">The data is on GitHub</a>.) <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/obama-2016-budget-seeks-expand-educational-opportunity-all-students">Among the education-related items</a>: an increase in $2.7 billion for Elementary and Secondary Education Act programs, including $1 billion for Title I; more details on &#8220;America&#8217;s College Promise&#8221; (that is, two years of free <strong>community college</strong>); $29.7 billion for <strong>Pell Grants</strong>; a <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/02/obama_budget_calls_for_revivin_1.html">rebirth</a> (sorta) of the Enhancing Education Through Technology program. The budget would close a loophole that &#8220;<a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/02/383346101/white-house-may-close-loophole-that-sends-billions-to-for-profit-schools">sends billions to for-profit schools</a>.&#8221; The budget also revealed that <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/the-college-loan-bombshell-hidden-in-the-budget-114930.html">the student loan program had a $21.8 billion shortfall last year</a>. <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/151595/">Via The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>: &#8220;What Obama&#8217;s 2016 Budget Means for Higher Ed.&#8221; Chance of Congress accepting this budget: unlikely.</p>

<p><strong>FCC</strong> Chairman Tom Wheeler <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/technology/fcc-wheeler-net-neutrality.html">unveiled</a> new rules this week that would preserve <strong>net neutrality</strong> by reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service, governed by Title II. The FCC will vote on the rules by the end of the month. Broadband providers promise to sue.</p>

So, <strong>Governor Scott Walker</strong> proposes cutting $300 million from the state&#8217;s public higher education system. He proposes scrapping the &#8220;<a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/scott-walkers-uw-mission-rewrite-could-end-the-wisconsin-idea-b99439020z1-290797681.html">Wisconsin Idea</a>,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/05/drafting-error-or-gubernatorial-assault-expansive-view-higher-ed-wisconsin">changing the mission</a> of the state system from the &#8220;search for truth&#8221; to focus on meeting &#8220;the state&#8217;s workforce needs.&#8221; He wants to get rid of the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/02/04/wisconsin-gov-wants-cut-profit-regulatory-board">regulatory board</a> that oversees for-profit education in the state. He&#8217;s also proposing <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/02/04/walker-proposes-removing-funding-for-common_ap.html">cutting funding</a> for Common Core tests.</p>

<p>Following up on President Obama&#8217;s SOTU call for legislation protecting <strong>student privacy</strong>, <strong>Representatives Jared Polis</strong> and <strong>Luke Messer</strong> <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/02/student-data-privacy_U.S._house.html">say</a> they&#8217;ll draft a bill to do that. Polis has been a critic of the NSA&#8217;s massive data collection efforts, so maybe the bill will adequately address security and privacy and surveillance. LOL. Who am I kidding.</p>

<p><strong>Kansas Governor Sam Brownback</strong> has announced a <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/government-politics/article9352574.html">$44.5 million budget</a> cut to education in the state.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/7/7/5877505/colorado-contraceptives-teen-pregnancy-birth-control">Via Vox</a>: &#8220;A program that provides contraceptives to low-income women contributed to a 40-percent drop in <strong>Colorado</strong>&#8217;s teen birth rate between 2009 and 2013, according to state officials.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/2/1/7960051/cursive-common-core">Also via Vox</a>: &#8220;<strong>Cursive</strong> handwriting is useless, but politicians want students to learn it anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/29/krs-one-tucson_n_6575022.html">Via The Huffington Post</a>: &#8220;Earlier this month, the outgoing head of <strong>Arizona</strong>'s education department, John Huppenthal, said the &#8216;culturally relevant&#8217; curriculum offered by Tucson schools violated a 2010 law restricting ethnic studies. The letter of noncompliance cited the teaching of Mexican history, a Rage Against the Machine song and a KRS-One essay called &#8216;An Introduction to Hip Hop&#8217; as examples of the illegal promotion of ethnic solidarity or the overthrow of the U.S. government.&#8221; So <strong>KRS-One</strong> went to Arizona and gave a three hour lecture on the history of hip hop to students at Tuscon&#8217;s Cholla Magnet High School.</p>

<p><strong>England</strong>&#8217;s Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31079515">announced</a> a &#8220;war on illiteracy and innumeracy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <strong>French</strong> Parliament has passed a bill <a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/01/30/01016-20150130ARTFIG00248-le-wifi-desormais-interdit-dans-les-creches.php">banning WiFi</a> in nursery schools.</p>

<h3>Education and the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/laureate-lawsuit#.aaWE1Q0KE">Buzzfeed&#8217;s Molly Hensley-Clancy</a> looks at a lawsuit filed by students at the for-profit <strong>Walden University</strong> that &#8220;alleges that the school's rapid growth and focus on profit and marketing have created a dragged-out and misleading dissertation and thesis process, forcing students to spend more money on tuition.&#8221;</p>

<h3>MOOCs and Online Education</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.afr.com/p/national/education/coursera_sets_sights_on_universities_YoYzesiG11p0QtnEsDV8pI">From The Australian Financial Review</a>: &#8220;The company&#8217;s co-founder, <strong>Daphne Koller</strong>, said <strong>Coursera</strong> was rebuilding its ­platform &#8216;from the ground up&#8217; to allow students to commence courses &#8216;on demand&#8217; and to give university ­instructors access to student data on progress and performance. She said these two changes would allow universities and colleges to use Coursera&#8217;s online teaching packages in place of regular lectures allowing them to teach in areas where they don&#8217;t have enough in-house expertise.&#8221; The arc of ed-tech &#8220;innovation&#8221; is long and it bends towards the LMS, I guess.</p>
