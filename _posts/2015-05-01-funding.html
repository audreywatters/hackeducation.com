<p>I&#8217;ve updated <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13G5vM1m5KUy_Q6N4oiNyo9rEnjcYBVT4RB3eyjmE0ao/edit?usp=sharing">the spreadsheet</a> where I&#8217;m tracking on this year's ed-tech investment. Here are JSON files for <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/data/4-2015-startup-funding.json">startup funding</a> (broken down <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/data/4-2015-investor-data.json">by investors</a>), <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/data/4-2015-acquisitions.json">acquisitions</a>, and <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/data/4-2015-startup-mergers.json">mergers</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s only been a month since I reviewed <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/04/03/ed-tech-funding-q12015/">Q1 2015&#8217;s ed-tech investment data</a>, but with the acquisition of Lynda.com by LinkedIn this month, I thought all this was worth revisiting &#8211; particularly since the crack reporters at Pando wondered if that would &#8220;<a href="http://pando.com/2015/04/09/did-linkedins-acquisition-of-lynda-just-kill-the-ed-tech-space/">kill the ed tech space</a>.&#8221; </p>

<p>For what it&#8217;s worth &#8211; according to my record-keeping at least, investment was up just slightly in April over March. (But both are down from January and February when massive investments in Lynda.com ($186 million), SoFi ($200 million), and 17zuoye ($100 million) certainly skewed the numbers).</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting story to watch this year is the growing number of acquisitions &#8211; big deals not just in terms of the dollar figures but in terms of the brands involved. In April, LinkedIn bought Lynda.com for $1,500,000,000, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt paid $575,000,000 for most of Scholastic&#8217;s ed-tech business. These are the largest acquisitions of the year, topping Rakuten's acquisition of Overdrive for $410,000,000 and Pluralsight's acquisition of Code School for $36,000,000.</p>
