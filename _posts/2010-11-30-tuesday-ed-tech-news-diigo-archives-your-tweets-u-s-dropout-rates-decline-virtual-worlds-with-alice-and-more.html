<p>Dropout rates in the U.S. are on the decline, but as <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2033524,00.html">Andrew Rotherham</a> notes, "don't celebrate yet." The national graduation rate is up from 72% in 2001 to 75% in 2008.  And there were 260-some-odd fewer "dropout factories" in 2008 than in 2001.  But 8 states still have graduation rates below 70% and over 2 million students still attend schools with dropout rates of less than 60%.  Furthermore, the achievement gap between white students and students of color persists, with 81% of white students graduating, but only 62% of African American students do.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20024075-1.html">CNET</a> had an interesting story today about a game called "<a href="http://phylo.cs.mcgill.ca/eng/play.html">Phylo: A Human Computing Framework for Comparative Genomics</a>" Phylo is a genetic sequencing game, and in some ways it seems to be the opposite of a project like SETI, which uses distributed computing power in order to search for alien life.  Phylo uses distributed human power, and as the puzzles in the game are solved, the information is stored in a genetics information database, making the human analysis for available for scientists in a usable visual digest.</p>
