<p>The textbook rental company Bookrenter is spinning out its technology platform today to help campuses get a better handle on course materials -- not just textbooks, but all manner of digital content.  The new company is called <a href="http://rafter.com">Rafter</a>, and among its offerings is a nifty little tool called Rafter Discover.  Any educator can use it -- not just those whose campuses are Rafter clients -- in order to make smarter decisions about course material selection.  The tool helps peel back some of the mystery that shrouds the textbook industry -- with pricing, adoption, textbook lifecycle, and reviews.  (You can read my story on today's news over on <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/can-bookrenter-leverage-its-campus-bookstore-technology-challenge">Inside Higher Ed</a>)</p>
<p>Is it enough to help shake up the textbook publishing industry?  Stay tuned, I guess.</p>
<p>Things to be on the look for:  campuses now feeling that they, rather than publishers and copyright holders, can be the power-players (as in, forcing students to buy digital content as part of their tuition and fees).</p>
<p>Also noteworthy:  the California State Senate recently introduced Senate Bill 1328 that would require more data transparency around textbook usage. &nbsp;Will more pressure come from legislatures to "fix" the textbook problem or will it come from upstarts like Rafter or, <a href="/2012/02/22/scraping-data-from-college-bookstores-in-the-hunt-for-cheaper-textbooks/">as I wrote about last week</a>, will it come from student-focused endeavors.</p>
