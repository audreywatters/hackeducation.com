<p>Hooray! I have a story in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/Students-Are-Hacking-Their-School-Issued-iPads-Good-for-Them/280196/">The Atlantic</a> today -- the first piece I've had published there. I'm thrilled.</p>
<p>Although I haven't been doing much freelancing recently (because of <a href="http://teachingmachin.es">the book project</a>), I need to pick it up again. I tweeted last night that I'd like to find a place where I can publish a regular (and paid!) column on ed-tech -- ideally in a venue like The Atlantic that has broad reach and isn't solely an "education" or "technology" site. I'm open suggestions (and job offers).</p>
<p>Consider my thoughts on the recent news that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/Students-Are-Hacking-Their-School-Issued-iPads-Good-for-Them/280196/">students are "hacking" their school-issued iPads</a> -- <em>and why that's a good thing</em> -- as a representative sample of <a href="http://audreywatters.com/cv.html">my work</a>.</p>
