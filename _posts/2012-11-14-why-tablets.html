<p>Why all the excitement over tablets for education?</p>
<p>This is something I've been stewing about for a long, long time. Note: I didn't ask, "why personal computers?"</p>
<p>But having written up a <a href="/2012/11/13/ed-tech-year-in-review-2012-2011/">Top Trends in Ed-Tech post</a> yesterday, I was struck once again by the abundance of hype over tablets. I confess, I just can't do the work I need to do on an iPad, but I don't want to suggest that that means they're useless for others. It does make me wonder about what I'm missing by being a skeptic, as well as what students are missing when we give them tablets and not (my preference) laptops.</p>
