<p>I arrived home yesterday after an amazing week in the Bay Area.  While the initial impetus was to attend a couple of startup pitch and demo events, I made the trip very ed-tech focused with visit with Rafael Corrales, co-founder of <a href="http://www.learnboost.com">LearnBoost</a> and a morning spent at the Googleplex, meeting the executives involved with some of Google's various educational programs.  I also heard <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2010/08/06/a-journalist-an-editor-an-engineer/">Elon Musk</a> speak - not at an ed-tech event, mind you - a strong reminder of the importance of a imagination and a solid scientific education.</p>
<p>That being said, I'm far behind on reading my RSS feeds and on writing in my own blogs, and while I plan to follow up with a ton of stories in the coming days about back-to-school-with-education-technology, here are some of the things other folks over have written over the past few days that have caught my eye:</p>
