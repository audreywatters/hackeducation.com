<h2>Education Politics</h2>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong> State Senator Al Melvin is terribly concerned about the <strong>Common Core State Standards</strong>. &ldquo;Some of the reading material is borderline pornographic,&rdquo; he said during an education committee meeting. Even worse? The math portion substitutes letters for numbers. <a href="http://wonkette.com/542547/arizona-state-senator-will-protect-children-from-freaky-weird-math-that-includes-letters">As Wonkette writes</a>, &ldquo;Thank goodness Melvin paid attention to the briefing memo, &lsquo;Al Gebra Determined to Strike in U.S.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong> Governor Chris Christie has <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/02/27/680060njeducationcommissioner_ap.html">appointed</a> David Hespe to be the state&rsquo;s new education commissioner. Hespe, who&rsquo;s had the gig before, will take over from Chris Cerf, who recently resigned to take a job at News Corps&rsquo; education company <strong>Amplify</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>New York City</strong> Mayor Bill de Blasio will block three <strong>charter schools</strong> from using space inside public school buildings, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/nyregion/de-blasio-seeks-to-halt-3-charter-schools-from-moving-into-public-spaces.html">reports The New York Times</a>, reversing the policy of his predecessor Michael Bloomberg who gave space to charters rent-free.</p>
<p>Budget cuts <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-lausd-libraries-20140224,0,5992443.story#axzz2uddaqSmF">mean</a> that half of <strong>LAUSD</strong>&rsquo;s elementary and middle schools don&rsquo;t have librarians. So let them eat iPads, right?</p>
<p>The Department of Education issued a report (<a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oig/auditreports/fy2014/a07l0001.pdf">PDF</a>) on <strong>Title IV</strong> arguing that &ldquo;additional safeguards are needed to help mitigate the risks that are unique to the distance education environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>White House</strong> holds its first-ever <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/02/today-the-first-ever-white-house-student-film-festival/">Student Film Festival</a> today.</p>
<p><strong>President Obama</strong> also <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/02/my-brothers-keeper-a-new-white-house-initiative-to-empower-boys-and-young-men-of-color/">announced</a> a new White House initiative, <strong>My Brother&rsquo;s Keeper</strong>, aimed at empowering boys and young men of color.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe</strong> and <strong>Prezi</strong> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/28/prezi-and-adobe-join-obamas-connected-tech-initiative-for-us-classrooms/">have joined</a> the White House&rsquo;s <strong>ConnectED</strong> initiative, offering to give away millions in free software to schools. (Other participants include <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, and <strong>O&rsquo;Reilly Media</strong>.) So the nation&rsquo;s Prezi presentation nightmare will continue.</p>
<h2>Education and the Law</h2>
<p>The <strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</strong> has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/26/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-for-profit-college_n_4861022.html">filed suit</a> against <strong>ITT</strong>, accusing the for-profit school of &ldquo;of forcing students into high-interest, private loans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>31 current and former <strong>University of Berkeley</strong> students have filed a complaint against the university alleging administrators mishandled sexual assault investigations. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-berkeley-assaults-20140227,0,1001606,full.story#axzz2uXYY9OF5">According to The LA Times</a>, &ldquo;the complaints allege that officials for years have discouraged victims from reporting assaults, failed to inform them of their rights and led a biased judicial process that favored assailants&rsquo; rights over those of their victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Mississippi</strong> is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/us/officials-seek-to-question-3-ole-miss-students-in-racist-episode.html">pushing for criminal charges</a> against 3 students who placed a noose around the neck of a statue in honor of James Meredith, the school&rsquo;s first black student.</p>
<p>The 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303775504579397751925493512?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303775504579397751925493512.html">ruled</a> against the <strong>University of Notre Dame</strong>, which had argued that providing Obama-care-mandated coverage for contraception forced the school to violate its religious beliefs.</p>
<h2>Ed-Tech Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Apple</strong> has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/26/apple-launches-big-improvements-for-ios-management-tools-for-enterprise-and-education/">released</a> some upgrades to its iOS deployment and management tools and have also added a COPPA-compliant way for kids under 13 to sign up for Apple IDs.</p>

<p><strong>Texas A&amp;M University</strong> will <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/quickwire-texas-am-u-stadium-will-add-163-foot-wide-video-screen/50683">soon have</a> a 163-foot-wide video screen for its stadium &ndash; &ldquo;the largest video display in all of college football.&rdquo; Because higher education.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong>, or rather Internet.org (which is Facebook plus handset makers), <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/Content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=808&amp;NewsAreaID=2&amp;ClientID=1">announced</a> <strong>SocialEDU</strong>, a MOOC initiative and partnership with <strong>edX</strong> to offer &ldquo;localized education content&rdquo; in Rwanda. (While it doesn&rsquo;t examine the education component of this initiative, Mat Honan&rsquo;s article &ldquo;<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2014/02/facebook-plans-conquer-world-slew-low-end-handsets/">Facebook&rsquo;s Plan to Conquer the World &ndash; With Crappy Phones and Bad Networks</a>&rdquo; is totally relevant and worth a read.)</p>
<p>The publishers <strong>Springer</strong> and <strong>IEEE</strong> have had to <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/publishers-withdraw-more-than-120-gibberish-papers-1.14763">withdraw</a> more than 120 papers from their subscription services after a discovery that these articles were &ldquo;computer-generated nonsense.&rdquo; Or as us humanities folks call it with a smirk, &ldquo;Sokal-as-a-service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NSBA is <a href="http://schoolboardnews.nsba.org/2014/02/nsba-new-regency-penguin-books-and-the-filmmakers-to-distribute-12-years-a-slave-to-public-high-schools/">partnering</a> with New Regency to distribute <strong><em>12 Years a Slave</em></strong> &ndash; along with book and study guide &ndash; to high schools.</p>

Because this mobile learning thing is gonna be huge. Or something.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson</strong> has <a href="http://www.pearsoned.com/students-can-now-take-parcc-and-colorado-measures-of-academic-success-science-and-social-studies-assessments-on-ipad/#.UxDINvRdWRx">released</a> the latest version its test-taking app for iPad. Whee.</p>
<p>The IMS Global Learning Consortium has <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/pressreleases/IMSPR20140224.pdf">released</a> version 2 of the <strong>Learning Tools Interoperability</strong> (LTI) specification, for all your one-click educational app/LMS integration needs.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s not enough data standard excitement for one week, <strong>SIF Data Model</strong> Implementation Specification <a href="https://www.sifassociation.org/NewsRoom/Press%20Releases/SIF%20Data%20Model%20Specification%20North%20America%203-1%20Hits%20the%20Marketplace.pdf">3.1</a> is out too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;<a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/02/28/the-federated-oer-wiki-is-up-and-running/">kinda sorta working model</a>&rdquo; of a federated <strong>OER Wiki</strong>, brought to you by Tim Owens and Mike Caulfield.</p>
<p><strong>Macmillan</strong> e-books are now available to schools and libraries via <strong>OverDrive</strong>, <a href="http://www.the-digital-reader.com/2014/02/26/macmillan-expands-library-ebooks-schools-us-canada">says The Digital Reader</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Oppia</strong>, &ldquo;a tool for interactive learning,&rdquo; was announced <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2014/02/oppia-tool-for-interactive-learning.html">in a post on the Google Open Source Blog</a>. A project built by Google engineers on &ldquo;20% time,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href="https://www.oppia.org">oppia.org</a> is not a <strong>Google</strong> product, and Google bears no responsibility for the content of this website.&rdquo; The Open Universtiy&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2014/02/27/oppia-a-learning-journey-platform-from-google/">Tony Hirst takes a closer look</a> at the new tool.</p>
<p>There was <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/aff98eb0-97ef-11e3-8c0e-00144feab7de.html#axzz2uM6BrzLR">an article in the Financial Times</a> about <strong>Second Life</strong> in higher education this week. I kid you not. I had to check the publishing date, like, 4 times to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t 2007 again. And FT parent company Pearson wonders why it&rsquo;s struggling to make the transition to digital? (See profit warning below.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Colorado Software Firm Is Programming Your Next Professor,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmarshallcrotty/2014/02/25/a-colorado-software-firm-is-programming-your-next-professor/">reads the headline in <strong>Forbes</strong></a>, a publication that never fails to tout a technodystopian future as some sort of great business deal. &ldquo;As education costs increase, it&rsquo;s not unreasonable to think that professors, teachers, adjuncts, and tutors could at least be partially replaced by a $7,000 programmable character who never sleeps or unionizes, or emotionally overreacts to student behavior.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Money Money Money</h2>
<p>Ed-tech news and product review site&nbsp;<strong>Edsurge</strong> has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-02-26-edsurge-wraps-up-funding-launching-new-initiatives">raised</a> $1.5 million in a Series A round of funding.

<h2>Research and Data</h2>
<p>&ldquo;How Well Aligned Are Textbooks to the <strong>Common Core Standards</strong> in Mathematics,&rdquo; asks <strong>USC</strong> education professor Morgan Polikoff. I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead and let you guess. Or, even better, you can read <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~polikoff/textbooks.pdf">his research paper</a>. Spoiler alert: not well-aligned at all.</p>
<p>The real estate site <a href="http://www.redfin.com/research/reports/special-reports/2014/california-home-affordability-for-teachers.html"><strong>Redfin</strong> reports</a> that 83% of <strong>California</strong> home are not affordable on a teacher&rsquo;s salary. (And no homes within <strong>San Francisco</strong> are.) Clearly teachers, you need to raise some VC and/or learn to code.</p>
<p><strong>Childhood obesity</strong> is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/health/obesity-rate-for-young-children-plummets-43-in-a-decade.html?hp&amp;_r=2">down</a>. Yay!

<p><strong>Rob Killion</strong> has stepped down as executive director of the <strong>Common Application</strong>, an organization that has built an online application site that serves some 500+ colleges and universities. As the name suggests, the application process is shared; but its technology has been fairly broken this year, and <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/27/common-application-following-difficult-year-announces-departure-executive-director">Inside Higher Ed reports</a> that the organization&rsquo;s board of directors requested Killion&rsquo;s exit as a result.</p>
