<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/10/06/facebook-will-double-its-250-million-investment-in-vr-content/">Via Venture Beat</a>: &#8220;<strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Oculus</strong> promise millions in funding for diverse apps, education, and more for VR.&#8221; From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zuckerberg revealed that he wants to ensure that education has a chance to flourish in VR. That led to him announcing a $10 million fund specifically for learning applications.</p>
<br />
<p>&#8220;Education is going to be a powerful example of the potential of VR,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Already today, 10 percent of the experiences in the Oculus Store are education.&#8221;</p>
<br />
<p>On top of the funding, Oculus will get a specific spot in its store just for education. This could transform how teaching works going forward, and Facebook will stand at the center of that change.</p>
