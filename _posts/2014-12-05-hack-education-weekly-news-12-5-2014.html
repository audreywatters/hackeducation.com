<h2>The LAUSD iPad Saga Continues: A Federal Grand Jury Investigation</h2>
<p><strong>FBI</strong> agents took some 20 boxes of documents from <strong>LAUSD</strong> offices in what looks to be a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-fbi-agents-take-ipad-documents-from-la-school-district-20141202-story.html">federal grand jury investigation</a> into the deal with <strong>Pearson</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong>, and the district. It's <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/is-la-unified-the-target-of-fbi-probe-or-could-it-be-a-contractor/">unclear</a> if LAUSD or one of the companies is the target of the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ipads-explainer-20141204-story.html">criminal investigation</a>.</p>

Despite a recommendation that charges be pursued, Bennett has never faced prosecution,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2014/12/02/ap-exclusive-bennett-probe-called-prosecution/19793119/">reports the AP</a>.</p>

The state&rsquo;s solution has caused a new set of challenges for some districts in one of the country&rsquo;s most impoverished areas. Some students don&rsquo;t have computers or home Internet access. And the school district might lose some state and federal aid.&rdquo;</p>

In what feels like a huge setback to those working to end rape culture on college campuses and a huge slap-in-the-face to victims of sexual violence, the magazine <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/a-note-to-our-readers-20141205">now says</a> it apologizes and &ldquo;we have come to the conclusion that our trust in [the victim] was misplaced.&rdquo;</p>
