<p>I have given a number of talks lately on this topic: <a href="http://storify.com/audreywatters/whose-education-data-is-it">who owns education data?</a> (And will give a couple more next week -- on a panel at SXSWedu and then, a related but expanded version as a keynote at WebWise.)</p>
<p>I'm not sure why the topic has resonated so deeply with me lately -- perhaps it's all the talk outside the ed-tech sector about the promises of big data; perhaps it's the metaphor of mining vis-a-vis data mining; perhaps it's this new obsession with becoming "data-driven" that I hear politicians posit for schools and students (and thus all the ed-tech products that follow suit); perhaps it's that I am both intrigued and concerned by the emerging field of learning analytics; perhaps it's because I continue to be frustrated by our lack of attention to terms of service and to control of our content (which is data); perhaps it's that I struggle with thinking through exactly how to navigate the personal and the public demands for sharing education data.</p>
<p>Anyway, last night I facilitated a session as part of <a href="http://etmooc.org/">ETMOOC</a>, a MOOC about education technology and media, organized by Alec Couros. &nbsp;Here's a <a href="https://t.co/bMefJKyuOu">link</a> to the webinar recording and a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/audreywatters/etmooc-who-owns-your-education-data">link</a> to my slides, along with the wonderful visual notes taken by the even-more-wonderful <a href="http://gforsythe.ca/">Giulia Forsythe</a>.</p>
