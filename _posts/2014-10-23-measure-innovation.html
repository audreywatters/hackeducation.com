<h2>What is &ldquo;Innovation&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>What  is &ldquo;innovation&rdquo;? What do we mean by the term? Who uses it? And how?  Where does this concept come from? Where is a fixation with &ldquo;innovation"  taking us? Does invoking the term &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; serve to <em>describe</em> practices? Or does it serve to <em>shape</em> practices?</p>
<p>As  &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; becomes increasingly important in our discussions about  the future of education, these questions all seem worth asking.</p>
<p>Of  course, a dictionary definition suggests that &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; might mean  nothing more than &ldquo;something new.&rdquo; According to Merriam Webster at  least, innovation is "a new idea, a new method, a new device.&rdquo; It is  "the act or process of introducing a new idea, a new method, a new  device."</p>
<p>That  means that almost anything, particularly if it&rsquo;s tied to technology or  gestures towards the future, can be labeled an &ldquo;innovation.&rdquo; That  technology piece is important, however. Indeed, right there, embedded in  the Merriam Webster definition, is a nod to technology: &ldquo;a new device.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What kind of technology? Well, here are the dictionary's examples of how the word might be used in a sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;the latest innovation in computer technology&rdquo;</li>
<li>"Through technology and innovation, they found ways to get better results with less work.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>These  examples help illustrate that, in popular usage at least, the new  ideas, methods, and devices that comprise &ldquo;innovation" have to do with  computers. They also concern labor issues, and they have to do with  speed and efficiency. These examples highlight show how tightly bound  &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; has become with technology and offer a hint perhaps as to  why technologists are sometimes quick to conflate the adoption of new  tools with the adoption of new ideas and practices. Technology counts as  &ldquo;innovation,&rdquo; even when we use it to do the same old stuff.</p>
<p>Interestingly,  the Merriam Webster dictionary definition of "innovation" leaves out  the notion of &ldquo;change.&rdquo; Defined this way, innovation isn&rsquo;t necessarily  about transformation, and the direction of transformation isn't  important. "Innovation" is simply &ldquo;a new <em>thing</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Measuring Innovation in Education</h2>
<p>The  Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), known best  in some education circles perhaps for its PISA tests, has just issued a  report on "<a href="http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/measuring-innovation-in-education.htm#ES">Measuring Innovation in Education</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OECD asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do  teachers innovate? Do they try different pedagogical approaches? Are  practices within classrooms and educational organisations changing? And  to what extent can change be linked to improvements? <strong>A measurement agenda is essential to an innovation and improvement strategy in education</strong>. Measuring Innovation in Education offers new perspectives on addressing the need for such measurement. [emphasis mine]<br /> </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how countries rank &mdash; ah, the element of international competition &mdash; in terms of &ldquo;innovation&rdquo;:</p>
<p>In the US, below-average performance on OECD rankings prompts hand-wringing headlines like "<a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/report-finds-u-s-schools-rank-below-average-in-innovation-1405635683">Report Finds U.S. Schools Rank Below Average in Innovation</a>&rdquo;&nbsp; and "<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-07-22-not-just-the-pisa-oecd-says-u-s-schools-also-behind-on-innovation">Not Just the PISA: OECD Says U.S. Schools Also Behind on &lsquo;Innovation</a>&rsquo;&rdquo;  &mdash; often used to confirm an education reform narrative that schools  simply "good enough," and in this case, aren&rsquo;t as "innovative" as the  business sector and need to become more like the latter.</p>
<p>But the findings of the OECD report do suggest otherwise. According to the executive summary (<a href="http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/executive-summary.pdf">PDF</a>),  "Contrary to common belief, there is a fair level of innovation in the  education sector, both relative to other sectors of society and in  absolute terms. 70% of graduates employed in the education sector  consider their establishments as highly innovative, on par with the  economy average (69%).&rdquo; One issue, according to the report, is the speed  of adoption of innovative practices &mdash; this is where education falls  slightly below average when compared to other sectors of the economy  (The report notes a difference between higher ed and primary and  secondary schools. It contends that the former adopts innovations at an  above average rate, while the latter two lag behind.)</p>
<h2>Wait, How Do You Measure Innovation?</h2>
<p>Despite  the attempts to measure it, innovation is never really clearly or  consistently defined in the OECD report (raising plenty of questions  about the conclusions and the rankings). But here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.oecd.org/unitedstates/Measuring-Innovation-in-Education-USA.pdf">one sentence</a> that comes close to a definition, or at least a guide of what to look for: "<em>In  education, innovation can take place through either significant changes  in the use of a particular educational practice or the emergence of new  practices in an educational system</em>.&rdquo; [emphasis mine] That is, &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; means changing practices &mdash; organizationally and pedagogically.</p>
<p>But, again, change to what end? The interest, says the OECD, is in locating &ldquo;improvement strategies&rdquo; in education.</p>
<p>So how, in turn, do you define improvement?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To  determine each educational system&rsquo;s top five innovations in pedagogic  and organisational practices, data from three international education  datasets &ndash; Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study  (TIMSS), Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), and  the Programme on International Student Assessment (PISA) &ndash; were analysed  to identify the areas in which each education system has demonstrated  emerging or changing organisational and pedagogic practices over a  specific period.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innovation,&rdquo; according to the OECD, is linked to test scores.</p>
<p>Indeed, the United State&rsquo;s top organizational innovations, according to the OECD:</p>
<ol> </ol>
<ul>
<li>More use of student assessments for monitoring school progress</li>
<li>More use of assessments for national or district benchmarking</li>
<li>More use of assessment data to inform parents of student progress</li>
<li>More external evaluation of secondary school classrooms</li>
<li>More parental service on secondary school committees</li>
</ul>
<ol> </ol>
<p>Compare this to Korea&rsquo;s organizational innovations (the country is ranked number 3 in the OECD report):</p>
<ol> </ol>
<ul>
<li>More peer evaluation of teachers in secondary education</li>
<li>More remedial education in secondary schools</li>
<li>More enrichment education in secondary schools</li>
<li>More tracking of secondary achievement data</li>
<li>More fundraising and outreach by school principals</li>
</ul>
<ol> </ol>
<p>Although  the Merriam Webster dictionary definition I cited at the top of this  article would suggest that &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; tends to involve technology,  many of the innovations listed here do not. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/07/21/this-is-educational-innovation/">The Washington Post&rsquo;s Valerie Strauss</a> contends in her response to the OECD report that none of the  &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; in the report involve the use of computers in the  classroom (although arguably assessment and data-tracking are  increasingly likely to be mediated by technology). That&rsquo;s not quite  accurate.</p>
<p>The Russian Federation (which ranks fifth on this list)  is credited with &ldquo;more use of computers as reference resources.&rdquo; (But it  is also credited with the innovation of "More use of textbooks as  primary resources in secondary science classrooms" -- just one example  of how some of these "innovations" are hard to reconcile.) The Russian  Federation "also saw large gains in the proportion of primary and  secondary students with access to the Internet in the classroom. Between  2003 and 2011, the percentage of 8th grade mathematics and science  students with Internet access in their classroom rose by 33% points and  36% points, respectively, the largest gains in this metric for any  educational system included in this report.&rdquo; Similarly, The Netherlands  (ranked number 4) is credited with more computer and Internet access at  the primary level.</p>
<h2>Is This the &ldquo;Innovation&rdquo; We&rsquo;re Looking for?</h2>
<p>So  students in Russian Federation and The Netherlands have more computer  access. But how are computers being used?&nbsp; Simply to "look up  references"? Or to do something transformational?</p>
<p>Contrast the OECD report with the recent <a href="http://modernlearners.com/eml-masterclass-creating-an-innovative-culture-of-learning/">EML Masterclass on &ldquo;Creating an Innovative Culture for Learning&rdquo;</a>&nbsp; featuring a conversation with Esme Capp, the principal of Princes Hill Primary School.</p>
<p>Capp  notes that her school has an &ldquo;ever evolving shared vision for the  school&rdquo; &mdash; and the emphasis on a change could easily be seen as valuing  innovation. But it&rsquo;s not simply about change-for-the-sake-of-change, and  it&rsquo;s not simply about change-for-the-sake-of-test-scores. And it's a  "shared vision," not a definition of "innovation" imposed from the  outside.</p>
<p>Capp describes some of her school&rsquo;s principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We  ended up with five different principles of learning which really drive  the thinking of what's happening within the school. They center around  that children learn through engagement in social context, be it cultural  context at home, their peers, all sorts of clubs, all sorts of  engagement. That children learn through multiple forms of expression,  not just literacy and numeracy but have multiple ways to engage within  the world. </em></p>
<p><em>That they learn through active participation  and through complexity, engaging in meaningful, complex projects and  ideas where they make connections to their every day world. That  children develop motives to engage but that motive isn't really totally  intrinsic, that the motive can be developed through provocations,  through questioning, through engagement within the environments, and  that children learn through the unity of emotion and intellect.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  culture fostered by the school community at Princes Hill Primary School  can easily be described as &ldquo;innovative.&rdquo; Moreover, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;progressive&rdquo;  and it&rsquo;s student-centered. Those are values that the OECD report doesn&rsquo;t  measure and doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;count."</p>
<p>So we come full circle again:&nbsp; What  is &ldquo;innovation&rdquo;? What do we mean by the term? Who uses it? And how?  Where does this concept come from? Where is a fixation with &ldquo;innovation"  taking us? Does invoking the term &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; serve to <em>describe</em> practices? Or does it serve to <em>shape</em> practices?</p>
<p><em>And to what end?</em></p>
