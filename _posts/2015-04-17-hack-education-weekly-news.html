<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/04/16/bipartisan-no-child-left-behind-rewrite-clears-senate-education-committee">The NCLB rewrite has made it out of committee</a> on a unanimous vote. Whee.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-cps-federal-inquiry-met-20150415-story.html">From the Chicago Tribune</a>: &#8220;Federal authorities are investigating Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett and a $20.5 million contract the district awarded on a no-bid basis to a training academy that formerly employed her.&#8221; In light of this story and recent <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/7/71/352887/deborah-quazzo-companies-got-1-3-million-cps-funded-charters">concerns over the business dealings of ed-tech VC and CPS board member Deborah Quazzo</a>, it&#8217;s pretty great timing for this story from Edsurge: &#8220;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-04-15-what-edtech-companies-need-to-do-to-sell-to-chicago-public-schools">What Edtech Companies Need to Do To Sell to Chicago Public Schools</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The European Union is accusing Google of antitrust violations, accusing it of &#8220;abusing its dominance in web searches.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/business/international/european-union-google-antitrust-case.html">More via The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/law-policy-and-it/eu-and-google">IHE blogger Tracy Mitrano</a>.</p>

<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/04/17/ohio-bill-would-effectively-bar-faculty-unions-public-colleges">Inside Higher Ed reports</a> that a bill before the Ohio House Finance Committee would &#8220;reclassify professors who participate in virtually anything other than teaching and research as supervisors or managers, and therefore exempt from collective bargaining. So serving on a committee, for example, turns a professor into a manager.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slate&#8217;s Rebecca Schuman <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2015/04/north_carolina_education_bill_it_would_require_public_university_professors.html">excoriates</a> a proposed North Carolina bill that would require all professors at the state&#8217;s public universities to teach a 4&#8211;4-load.</p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/corinthian-colleges-will-face-30-million-fine#.sbQxJDjYx">via Hensley-Clancy</a> (and related to the whole &#8220;troubled college&#8221; business), &#8220;the Department of Education will fine Corinthian Colleges $29.6 million for lying to students at its Heald College chain, citing almost 1,000 examples of defrauding students about job placement rates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8383425/rand-paul-tax-deductible-tuition">Rand Paul wants to make college tuition tax-deductible</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p>The Atlanta educators recently convicted for their roles in the district&#8217;s cheating scandal were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/us/atlanta-school-workers-sentenced-in-test-score-cheating-case.html">sentenced</a> this week. The sentences include up to seven years in prison.</p>

Students in New York are also opting out at such a rate that there are concerns the state might not meet the requirement that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/04/16/parents-opt-out-standardized-tests/25896607/">95%</a> to take them.</p>

<p>&#8220;PARCC and test provider Pearson are trying to trim the time of their Common Core tests by combining the two waves of testing into one,&#8221; <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/04/parcc_may_dump_its_two-part_co.html">according to The Plain Dealer</a>. Currently the tests take about 5 hours for math and 5 hours for English.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2015/04/pearson_fights_award_of_big_california_testing_contract_to_ets.html">Pearson is asking</a> the state of California to re-bid a testing contract &#8220;potentially worth a quarter of a billion dollars, arguing that a tentative agreement with a rival vendor is misguided, and illegal.&#8221;</p>

<h3>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h3>
<br />
<p>A bit of an accreditation hiccup in Yale&#8217;s plans to offer its Physician Assistant degree online via 2U. <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2015/04/09/online-pa-program-proposal-rejected/">In the words of the Yale Daily News</a>: &#8220;Online PA Program Proposal Rejected.&#8221; &#8220;Delayed&#8221; might be a more accurate verb.</p>

The story contains the phrase &#8220;compound learning object,&#8221; which when I read it I just <em>knew</em> was going to make David Wiley freak out. <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3854">Here&#8217;s his response</a>, a little history lesson about learning objects (<a href="https://darcynorman.net/2015/04/15/learning-objects-must-die/">die die die</a>) and the Reusability Paradox.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress is <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2015/04/library_of_congress_seeks_teams_to_develop_k-12_apps_on_congress_civics_1.html">looking for people to build educational apps</a>.
