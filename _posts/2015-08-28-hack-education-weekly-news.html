<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>Tomorrow is the tenth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina hitting land. (It&#8217;s also the tenth anniversary of <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/08/29/the-real-reason-i-dropped-out-of-a-phd-program/">a very personal loss for me</a>, and for this and a million other reasons I find the reflections on the tragedy emotionally exhausting.)</p>

<p>Parents and activists in Chicago are on a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/in-chicago-hunger-strikers-fight-for-a-high-school/2015/08/26/100c4832-4c13-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html?wprss=rss_education">hunger strike</a> to protest the closure of Walter H. Dyett High School, a public school in their South Side neighborhood.</p>

<p>The New York City Department of Education is <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/e-books-nyc-public-schools-leave-blind-advocates-article-1.2336926">delaying</a> the e-book deal it had struck with Amazon &#8211; the company was poised to manage a book marketplace for students &#8211; following letters from the National Federation of the Blind noted that the move would exclude the visually impaired.</p>

<p><a href="http://laschoolreport.com/lausd-launches-probe-into-district-email-use-for-ashley-madison/">Via the LA School Report</a>: &#8220;LA Unified said today its inspector general is &#8216;looking into&#8217; the possibility that nearly 100 district employees used district email addresses to contact ashleymadison.com, a website that promotes extra-marital affairs, calling itself &#8216;the most famous name in infidelity and married dating.&#8217;&#8221; (Meanwhile, as Gizmodo&#8217;s Annalee Newitz writes, &#8220;<a href="http://gizmodo.com/almost-none-of-the-women-in-the-ashley-madison-database-1725558944">Almost None of the Women in the Ashley Madison Database Ever Used the Site</a>.&#8221;)</p>

<p>The Department of Education <a href="https://medium.com/@culatta/what-works-2dbca6730ae1">plans</a> to evaluate ed-tech&#8217;s effectiveness.

<p>&#8220;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is considering taking legal action against Navient Corp., the country&#8217;s largest student loan servicer and a former division of Sallie Mae, after an investigation into the company&#8217;s disclosures and late fees,&#8221; <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/government-considering-legal-action-against-former-sallie-ma?utm_term=4ldqpia#.glVK6bDWK">Buzzfeed&#8217;s Molly Hensley-Clancy reports</a>.</p>

<h3>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h3>
<br />
<p>MOOC startups are still raising venture capital like it&#8217;s 2012! (Details in the &#8220;funding&#8221; section below.)</p>

<p>Well, #notallMOOCs: &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2015/08/amplifys_mooc_is_sold_and_renamed_as_edhesive.html">Amplify&#8217;s MOOC Is Sold, and Renamed as &#8216;Edhesive&#8217;</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>MIT and Harvard have published research on <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/cheating-moocs-0824">how people cheat in MOOCs</a>: they create multiple accounts. Inconceivable!</p>

<p>According to the headline in The New York Times, &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/nyregion/online-summer-courses-attracting-college-bound-high-schoolers.html">How High Schoolers Spent Their Summer: Online, Taking More Courses</a>.&#8221; Many of those interviewed in the story, which suggests that MOOCs are showing up on college applications, work at Ivies, so I&#8217;m not really sure how much we can extrapolate from their stories. It does remind me of <a href="http://harvardx.harvard.edu/files/harvardx/files/ses_and_mooc_enrollment_lak_colloquium_hx_working_paper_submission3.pdf">what Justin Reich found in his research on those in HarvardX courses</a>: that those signing up for MOOCs were more affluent than average and more likely to come from families with high levels of parental educational attainment. But do carry on, NYT, with your MOOC hype.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in MOOC hype: &#8220;<a href="http://www.educationdive.com/news/moocs-show-promise-in-complementing-uc-san-diegos-campus-offerings/404342/">MOOCs show promise in complementing UC-San Diego&#8217;s campus offerings</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oakland Community College may halt most online classes,&#8221; <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2015/08/28/occ-online/71290028/">The Detroit News reports</a>. &#8220;The possibility of mass course cancellations arose after the state's largest community college was denied accreditation for online programs that would let students earn degrees while taking most or all of their courses outside traditional classrooms.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Meanwhile on Campus</h3>
<br />
<p>A story about Duke freshman balking at reading <em>Fun Home</em> went <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/24/living/fun-home-bechdel-duke-freshman-feat/index.html">viral</a> this week, no doubt because the story conforms to many larger narratives about morality, outrage, trigger warnings, and protest. <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/blogs/zunguzungu/against-students-stories/">Aaron Bady has the best analysis of the incident</a>.</p>

<p>The University of Maryland University College says it will be <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/08/28/umuc-go-textbook-free">textbook-free</a> by the fall of 2016.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 2013, Auburn University&#8217;s curriculum review committee took up the case of a small, unpopular undergraduate major called public administration. After concluding that the major added very little to the school&#8217;s academic mission, the committee voted to eliminate it.&#8221; That&#8217;s the lede of <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-auburn-athletics-and-academics-collide-1440635278">The Wall Street Journal article</a> that chronicles how Auburn&#8217;s athletics department insisted that the major, popular among football players, be retained.</p>

<h3>Data and &#8220;Research&#8221;</h3>
<br />
<p>The Reproducibility Project, as the name suggests, tries to reproduce social science research.

<p>The University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Graduate School of Education released a study on suspension and expulsion rates for black students, focusing on states with high rates of disciplining students. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/us/higher-expulsion-rates-for-black-students-are-found.html">Among the findings</a>: &#8220;While black students represented just under a quarter of public school students in these states, they made up nearly half of all suspensions and expulsions.
