<h2>Pepper Sprays</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.educatedreporter.com/2012/04/campus-cops-pepper-spray-community.html">Student protesting a <strong>tuition hike</strong> at Santa Monica College were pepper-sprayed by campus police</a>. The college has defended the action saying that the police offer was forced to release the spray in order to "preserve public and personal safety."  The protests were in part due to a plan to allow students to pay extra to get into classes that are already sold out, a move that critic say would favor wealthier students and undermine the community college system.</p>
<h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>
<p>One to watch:  how will the court case of Pearson, Cengage, and Macmillan v <strong>Boundless Learning</strong> play out for OER and open source digital textbook efforts?  The three publishers accuse the free textbook startup of copyright infringement.  <a href="/2012/04/05/free-textbook-startup-sued-by-major-publishers-for-copyright-infringement/">Read all about it</a>.</p>
<p>A teacher's aide in Michigan is <a href="http://legalclips.nsba.org/?p=13590">challenging in court</a> her suspension from work after refusing to give the school access to her <strong>Facebook</strong> account.</p>
<p>The MPAA granted <strong><em>Bully</em></strong> a <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pg-13-rating-granted-for-bully-by-mpaa-without-cutting-crucial-scene-146358165.html">PG-13 rating</a> this week, lowering it from an R and meaning that when the documentary about school bullying expands to new markets this weekend, more theaters will actually carry it (and more teens in turn, hopefully, will see it).</p>
<p>A look at <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/cc/PubArticleCC.jsp?id=1332715094599&amp;thepage=1">Law.com</a> about litigation challenging <strong>library e-reserve policies</strong>.  Lawsuits in several states accuse colleges, professors and librarians of copyright infringement for making materials available online.</p>
<h2>Software Launches and Updates</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://worldreader.org">Worldreader</a></strong>, the literary non-profit that has distributed Kindles full of e-books to students in sub-Saharan African, has released a <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2012/04/03/e-books-for-smart-kids-on-dumb-phones/">beta version of an app that'll provide the same e-reader functionality on cellphones</a>.</p>
<p>Harvard librarian Robert Darton <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/51353-at-columbia-lecture-harvard--s-robert-darnton-promises-digital-public-library-by-2013-.html">vowed</a> that the <strong><a href="http://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America</a></strong> will launch by April 2013.</p>
<p>I'd feared that the <strong>Google Art Project</strong> was one of the things that was going to get the ax when Larry Page shut down Google Labs.  (Remember that?  When Google said "<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/more-wood-behind-fewer-arrows.html">more wood behind fewer arrows</a>" and promised to stop focusing on extraneous projects&hellip; you know&hellip; like augmented reality goggles&hellip; or something&hellip; I digress)  But the Google Art Project got a nice <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2012/04/bringing-halls-of-museums-into.html">update</a> this week and now boasts art from 151 museums in 40 countries.  The project was built with help from <a href="http://khanacademy.tumblr.com/post/20407630687/khan-academy-and-the-google-art-project">Khan Academy's Smarthistory</a>, which contributed over 100 videos to the project.</p>

The startup was launched from the Stanford Business School last summer, raising $2 million from 40 alumni who gave an average of $50,000 each.  That money in turn was loaned to 100 graduate business students.</p>

<p><strong>Google Scholar</strong> introduced <a href="http://googlescholar.blogspot.com/2012/04/google-scholar-metrics-for-publications.html">a new metrics feature</a>, offering some insight into the reach of a particular publication.  The release came on April 1, I should note here, along with a bunch of other joke news releases.  We're hoping this one's real, because as <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/20-services-google-thinks-are-more-important-than-google-scholar/255420/">Alexis Madrigal just noticed</a>, Google Scholar's been booted from prime real estate on the Google toolbar.</p>

Stanford too <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2012/040212itunes.html">says</a> its content has topped 50 million downloads. At the same time, the Boston Bay State Banner <a href="http://www.baystatebanner.com/natl17-2012-04-05">reported this week</a> that many universities remain skeptical of iTunes U, comparing iTunes U to traditional LMS offerings.</p>
<h2>Hardware Upgrades(?)</h2>
<p>Talk of a <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/intel-storybook-tablet-tipped-for-sub-299-medfield-03221217/">Storybook tablet PC</a> from Intel, as part of its line of <strong>Classmates</strong> educational hardware.

<h2>Research and Data</h2>
<p>An in-depth look into our <strong>e-reading</strong> habits by the <a href="http://libraries.pewinternet.org/2012/04/04/the-rise-of-e-reading/">Pew Research Center</a>.  One-fifth of American adults (21%) say that they have read an e-book in the past year. The data suggests that e-books are a real boon to those who love to read. Those who read e-books "stand out in almost every way from other kinds of readers," according to Pew. "Foremost, they are relatively avid readers of books in all formats: 88% of those who read e-books in the past 12 months also read printed books. Compared with other book readers, they read more books. They read more frequently for a host of reasons: for pleasure, for research, for current events, and for work or school. They are also more likely than others to have bought their most recent book, rather than borrowed it."</p>
