<p>In a recent post over on Mario Armstrong's site, Terrance Gaines asks "<a href="http://www.marioarmstrong.com/2010/08/19/qr-code-whats-the-hold-up/">What's the hold up?</a>" in more widespread adoption of QR Codes -- it's a good question, as QR codes, despite their blocky-black-and-whiteness, have a lot of potential for educational usage, I think.</p>
<p>QR (Quick Response) Codes are a 2D matrix code that's readable by QR scanners and by mobile phones with cameras.  The information in a QR Code can include text, a URL, or other data.  And with the correct reader installed on your phone, this means that additional information can easily be decrypted.</p>
<p>I think we can add QR Codes to the long list of reasons why we need to revisit rules about "No cellphones in school," as there are a myriad of educational uses and school projects that they can be used for.</p>
