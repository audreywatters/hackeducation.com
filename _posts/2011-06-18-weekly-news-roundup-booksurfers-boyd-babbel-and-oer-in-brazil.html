<p><em>I thought that ed-tech news would be sparse now that school's out, but there was a lot happening this week.  You wouldn't guess it, of course, by the frequency with which I updated Hack Education this week.  My excuse:  travel (of course).  I was in New York for ReadWriteWeb's 2WAY Summit in which I had the pleasure of (finally) meeting the wonderful <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/">danah boyd</a> and of facilitating a great panel on kids and tech.  I've written up my thoughts on the contrasts between boyd's session and my own <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/hopes_fears_the_future_of_kids_tech_at_rww2way.php">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.booksurfers.co.uk/"><strong>Booksurfers</strong></a>, a new e-book series available only for the Kindle and aimed at readers age 9 to 12, follows four adventurer kids as they jump into -- well "booksurf" -- classic (and public domain) novels. The e-books lets readers switch back and forth between the plot of these adventure stories and the classic texts themselves. The first two titles are Treasure Island and The Wizard of Oz.</p>
<p>Language learning platform <a href="http://babbel.com"><strong>Babbel</strong></a> has added four new languages:  Indonesian, Polish, Turkish and Dutch, bringing its portfolio to 11 languages total.  Babbel's courses are browser-based and don't require any downloads.</p>
<p><strong>Intel</strong> is asking students to tell the company "<a href="http://scoop.intel.com/student-ideajam-inspiration-contest/">what inspires you to learn?</a>"  It's a contest for students age 14-18.  Students can submit entries of at leasat 50 words, but that can include other multimedia content.  The winner will receive a Toshiba laptop with Intel 2nd Generation Core i5 technology plus a Sony Internet TV for her or his school.  Submissions are due August 15.</p>
<p>Describing the featiures as "<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/knocking-down-barriers-to-knowledge.html">knocking down barriers to knowledge</a>," <strong>Google</strong> unveiled a number of updates to its search capabilities this week, including the ability to search by voice and by image via your computer.</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/06/10-million-grants-awarded-to-help-boost-college-readiness/">reported</a> earlier in the week on MindShift, the <a href="http://nextgenlearning.org/"><strong>Next Generation Learning Challenges</strong></a> has announced the winners of its latest round of grant recipients.  $7 million will go to fund projects aimed at boosting college readiness.</p>
<p><a href="http://punflay.com"><strong>Punflay</strong></a>, the makers of a virtual frog dissection app (see my recent MindShift<a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/05/animal-dissection-theres-an-app-for-that/">story</a> from earlier this year) has launched a special website, which means that those without iPads can now take advantage of the virtual dissection tools. The frogs are thankful.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> announced the winners of its <a href="http://fuse.microsoft.com/project/kodu.aspx">Kodu Cup</a>, a contest that challenged kids age 9 to 17 to build video games using <strong><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/kodu/">Kodu</a></strong>, the visual programming language.  The grand prize winner was 10-year-old Hannah Wyman, who built a game called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACc0aTbm794">Toxic</a>.</p>
<p>Good news for <strong>open educational resources</strong> from Brazil this week.

<p><strong>Apple</strong> has announced its new <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/campaigns/back_to_school">back-to-school offer</a> for students buying Macs for college.  No longer will a Mac purchase include a free iPod.  Instead, students will receive a $100 gift card for iTunes.</p>
<p>With an increasing interest in computer science majors,<strong>The New York Times</strong> asks "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/06/15/computer-sciences-sputnik-moment">Is this CS's Sputnik moment</a>?"</p>
