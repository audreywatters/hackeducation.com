<p>Every week,&nbsp;<a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a>&nbsp;and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week. This week we actually got to sit down face-to-face as we were both at <a href="http://educonphilly.org">Educon</a>. &nbsp;You can listen to last week's episode (in which we discuss our thoughts on <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/01/21/desmos-free-online-graphing-calculator-goes-html-5/">why HTML5 is important for education</a>, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/01/25/google-says-chromebooks-now-in-hundreds-of-schools/">Google Chromebooks</a>, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/01/26/google-plus-opens-to-teens/">Google+ for teens</a>, and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/01/26/why-pearsons-partnership-with-startup-weekend-edu-makes-me-sad/">Pearson's investment in Startup Weekend EDU</a>) below. &nbsp;</p>
