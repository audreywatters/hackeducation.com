<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>The <strong>FCC</strong> has committed $450 million in funding to improve public schools&rsquo; and libraries&rsquo; <strong>broadband</strong> under the <strong>E-Rate</strong> program. (<a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2014/db0508/DOC-326979A1.pdf">PDF</a>) But it's still moving forward with plans to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/technology/fcc-road-map-to-net-neutrality.html">end</a> <strong>net neutrality</strong>. So don't get too excited about "high speed Internet" in schools, eh?</p>
<p>Today is the 60th anniversary of&nbsp;<strong><em>Brown v Board of Education</em></strong>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/05/17/shocking-facts-about-school-segregation">But racial segregation remains in US schools</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>European Union Court of Justice</strong> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/technology/google-should-erase-web-links-to-some-personal-data-europes-highest-court-says.html">ruled</a> that <strong>Google</strong> must honor &ldquo;<strong>the right to be forgotten</strong>&rdquo; and remove links to incorrect and out-of-date information when individuals request it. (More on this over on Educating Modern Learners where it&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-7/">What You Should Know This Week</a>.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The Obama Administration has unveiled a new <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-75-million-first-world-competition">$75 million fund</a> to &ldquo;<strong>spur innovation in higher education</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senators Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Edward Markey (D-Massachusetts) are proposing <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/senators-intend-to-amend-federal-student-privacy-law/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">an update to <strong>FERPA</strong></a> that will, among other things, &ldquo;require schools to maintain and make available a list of all outside companies that have access to their students&rsquo; information.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Ras Baraka</strong> has been elected the new mayor of <strong>Newark</strong>. Baraka, the son of poet and jazz musician Amiri Baraka, will replace <strong>Cory Booker</strong>, now a US Senator. Baraka ran on a campaign of <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/05/ras-barakas-newark-victory.html">taking Newark back</a> from &ldquo;political bosses, Wall Street investors, and Governor Chris Christie, whose agendas, he said, had not served the city&rsquo;s struggling people.&rdquo; (More on that agenda in Dale Russakoff&rsquo;s story on Zuckerberg, Booker, and Christie&rsquo;s plans for the Newark schools <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/05/19/140519fa_fact_russakoff">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Although not directly related to ed-tech, this should give us concern: the <strong>Federal Circuit Court</strong> has reversed a lower court&rsquo;s ruling in the <strong>Oracle</strong> v <strong>Google</strong> case, finding that the Java APIs are copyrightable. (<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dangerous-ruling-oracle-v-google-federal-circuit-reverses-sensible-lower-court">The EFF responds</a>.)</p>
<p>Astronaut <strong>Chris Hadfield</strong> has <a href="http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/05/today-is-the-last-day-to-watch-astronaut-chris-hadfields-space-oddity-music-video/370797/">taken down</a> the video of his wonderful cover of &ldquo;<strong>Space Oddity</strong>&rdquo; filmed on the International Space Station since he only had permission to use the song for a year.</p>
<p>And still more IP brokenness: <strong>Achieve3000</strong> has been <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/05/prweb11850971.htm">granted a patent</a> for &ldquo;its system and method of providing differentiated nonfiction content to students based on their Lexile&reg;/reading levels.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Goldieblox</strong> has <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/06592527192/goldieblox-agreed-to-pay-charity-1-million-using-beastie-boys-girls.shtml">settled</a> its legal dispute with the <strong>Beastie Boys</strong> (it has used the band&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Girls&rdquo; in an ad without permission, and although it probably fell under fair use, it was pretty icky considering Adam Yauch&rsquo;s statement in his will that his music not be used in advertisements). The engineering toy company will contribute 1% of its revenue to a charity until it&rsquo;s paid $1 million.</p>
<h2>MOOCs</h2>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> co-founder <strong>Andrew Ng</strong> is <a href="http://recode.net/2014/05/16/baidu-hires-coursera-founder-andrew-ng-to-start-massive-research-lab/">stepping away</a> from his day-to-day responsibilities at the company (he remains Chairman of the Board) and joining the Chinese search giant <strong>Baidu</strong>.</p>
<p>PandoDaily&rsquo;s Carmel Deamicis has published a recent interview with <strong>Udacity</strong> co-founder <strong>Sebastian</strong> <strong>Thrun</strong>: &ldquo;<a href="http://pando.com/2014/05/12/a-qa-with-godfather-of-moocs-sebastian-thrun-after-he-disavowed-his-godchild/">A Q&amp;A with &lsquo;Godfather of MOOCs&rsquo; Sebastian Thrun after he disavowed his godchild</a>.&rdquo; And the religious reference in the headline isn&rsquo;t even the weirdest thing. Thrun says, for example, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re affluent, we can do a much better job with you, we can make magic happen.&rdquo; And &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about advancing education, filling the skills gap, and reinventing education for the 20th century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;MOOCs: Expectations and Reality&rdquo; (<a href="http://cbcse.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MOOCs_Expectations_and_Reality.pdf">PDF</a>): &ldquo;To date, there has been little evidence collected that would allow an assessment of whether MOOCs do indeed provide a cost-effective mechanism for producing desirable educational outcomes at scale. It is not even clear that these are the goals of those institutions offering MOOCs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/05/09/moocs-disruption-only-beginning/S2VlsXpK6rzRx4DMrS4ADM/story.html">MOOCs&rsquo; disruption is only beginning</a>&rdquo; insists <strong>Clayton Christensen</strong>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can MOOCs and Universities Co-Exist?&rdquo; <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303825604579515521328500810?curator=MediaREDEF">The Wall Street Journal asks</a> 3 white male American professors, with predictable results.</p>

<p><a href="https://shine.yahoo.com/ellen-good-news/mom-pays-off-every-student-s-balance-following-son-s-denial-of-school-lunch--184851942.html">Another story</a> about a student denied hot <strong>school lunch</strong> because of an outstanding balance on his account. &ldquo;Not only was the 16-year-old humiliated in front of his peers by the very public incident, but his name was also posted, along with that of lots of other students with delinquent expenses, on a list in the cafeteria for everyone to see.&rdquo; His mom stepped up and paid off the overdue balance for her son, as well as the balances for all the other students at the school in a similar situation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/nyregion/list-of-names-in-sex-assaults-roils-columbia.html">At <strong>Columbia University</strong></a>, lists of names of sexual assault perpetrators are showing up in women&rsquo;s bathrooms. 23 students recently filed a federal complaint charging that the university had failed to respond properly to sexual assault cases.</p>
<p>The <strong>Kansas Board of Regents</strong> has <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/05/14/312524014/in-kansas-professors-must-now-watch-what-they-tweet">finalized</a> its new social media policy restricting what public employees, including university professors, can say, including anything &ldquo;contrary to the best interests of the university.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p><strong>Robert Buckingham</strong>, a tenured professor and the Executive Director of the <strong>University of Saskatchewan</strong> School of Public Health, was <a href="http://www.saskatoonhomepage.ca/whistle-blower-prof-reportedly-fired/itemid_21">fired</a> this week for speaking out against the school administration&rsquo;s plans to slash budgets and jobs. Five weeks from retirement, Buckingham was escorted from campus and &ldquo;banned for life.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.thestarphoenix.com/health/Banned+from+campus+life/9837701/story.html">Facing huge outcry</a>, the university has <a href="https://pawsapps.usask.ca/announcements/attach/1135125/University%20of%20Saskatchewan%20reconsiders%20part%20of%20decision%20-%20FINAL.pdf">reconsidered</a> its decision.

<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/05/16/timely-reminder-cloud-compute.html">From Cory Doctorow</a>: &ldquo;As <strong>Adobe Creative Suite</strong> struggles with its <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/kb/creative-cloud-service-outage.html?scid=social_20140515_24011814">license-server outage</a>, stranding creative professionals around the world without a way of earning their living, a timely reminder: a cloud computer is a computer you&rsquo;re only allowed to use if the phone company and a DRM-peddling giant like Adobe gives you permission, and they can withdraw that permission at any time.&rdquo;</p>
