<h3>RIP Kalief Browder, 1993&#8211;2015</h3>
<br />
<p>Kalief Browder, a young man <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/06/before-the-law">profiled in a New Yorker story last year</a>, who spent three years in solitary confinement on Rikers Island without ever being committed of a crime, has died. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kalief-browder-1993-2015">He committed suicide</a>.</p>

<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>The Department of Education <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2015/06/debt-relief-for-corinthian-colleges-students/">announced</a> this week that it is forgiving the student loans of those who attended Corinthian College &#8211; or rather, those whose schools have been closed and those who believe that they were defrauded will be able to apply to have their loans discharged. More via <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/09/education/us-to-forgive-federal-loans-of-corinthian-college-students.html">The New York Times</a> and <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/6/8/8748535/corinthian-loan-forgiveness">Vox</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Education Department is beefing up its oversight over the hundreds of different companies that colleges hire for a wide range of services that it says are somehow related to federal student aid dollars and therefore subject to regulation,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/06/08/education-department-steps-oversight-companies-hired-colleges">according to Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>

<p>The Department of Education <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0615/morningeducation18721.html">might</a> issue new guidance on FERPA &#8220;after Oregon Democrats Sen. Ron Wyden and Rep. Suzanne Bonamici inquired about the legality of a recent case at the University of Oregon. That institution caused a stir when administrators said they acted under FERPA when accessing a student’s therapy records for its legal defense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has &#8220;outlined a sweeping college affordability agenda to &#8216;dramatically reform&#8217; higher education,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/06/11/elizabeth-warren-outlines-debt-free-college-plan-calls-more-funding-higher-ed">reports Inside Higher Ed</a>. That agenda includes a &#8220;debt-free option.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-america/education/sen-alexander-vows-to-block-new-obama-education-regulations-20150609">Senator Lamar Alexander has vowed</a> to block the Obama Administration&#8217;s new &#8220;gainful employment&#8221; rules.</p>

<p>Texas agriculture commissioner Sid Miller wants to reverse the state&#8217;s ban on deep fat fryers in school cafeterias. <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/06/10/413455593/freedom-not-fries-texas-official-wants-deep-fryers-back-in-schools">Because freedom</a>.</p>

<p>Former US Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was indicted recently for evading regulations around large bank withdrawals. It appears as though those withdrawals were being done in order to pay someone blackmailing him. And it appears as though the blackmailing involves <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-dennis-hastert-20150605-story.html">accusations of sexual assault</a> when Hastert was a teacher and wrestling coach.</p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/06/freedom-of-information-requests-turn-up-creationist-materials-in-schools/">FOIAs have uncovered</a> that &#8211; surprise, surprise &#8211; following passage of the Louisiana Science Education Act which protects teachers who teach anti-scientific ideas, schools in the state are indeed using creationist materials in lieu of teaching about evolution.</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p>The Virginia Supreme Court has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/06/09/va-supreme-court-says-lower-court-erred-in-sweet-briar-case-sends-it-back-as-advocates-cheer/">sent a ruling</a> on the closure of Sweet Briar College back to the lower court, which had denied a temporary injunction on the closure, for more arguments.</p>

<p>The University of Guelph has <a href="http://opened.uoguelph.ca/news.aspx">responded</a> to complaints about its plans to trademark &#8220;OpenEd.&#8221; (<a href="http://edutechnicalities.com/articles/opening-the-opened-discussion/">Rolin Moe responds</a> in turn.)</p>

<h3>Testing, Testing&#8230;</h3>
<br />
<p>Due to a printing error in the June 6 SAT, the College Board says it won&#8217;t score two sections of the test but <a href="https://lp.collegeboard.org/information-regarding-the-saturday-june-6-sat-administration">it assures everyone</a> that the test is still totally valid. &#8220;From fire drills and power outages to mistiming and disruptive behavior, school-based test administrations can be fragile, so our assessments are not.&#8221;</p>

<p>CTB/McGraw-Hill will pay the state of Georgia $4.5 million for problems it experienced with its testing service.</p>
