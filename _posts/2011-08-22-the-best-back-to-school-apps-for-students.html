<p>It's that time of year again -- time for the various and sundry blog posts listing out the best back-to-school tips, tracks, apps, hardware, and so on.  I've written one already for MindShift:  "<a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/08/the-most-anticipated-tech-tools-of-back-to-school-2011/">The Most Anticipated Tech Tools of Back-to-School 2011</a>," based on a survey -- as the title suggests -- about the tools educators are most looking forward to bringing with them back into the classroom this fall.</p>
<p>These sorts of back-to-school posts should be timely, good advice.  They're also good SEO, and I'm sure that motivates a lot of publications to make sure to create the content.  So in lieu of mimicking what <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/08/17/iphone-apps-students/">other blogs do</a> -- find one recently released book-buying app, go through the other things students might need in addition to <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/textbooks/">textbooks</a> -- a dictionary, a calculator, a way to record lectures, a map, for example -- and then find an iOS app to suit -- I thought I'd try something a little different with my SEO-juice.</p>
<p>Echoing like my <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/08/10/what-makes-an-innovative-e-bookapp-the-10-things-i-look-or-wish-for/">wishlist</a> for <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/ebooks/">e-books</a>, I thought I'd write a wishlist for back-to-school apps.  Some of the features I have on this wishlist do exist in certain apps (I've listed those where applicable), and so this list feels like far less of a pipe-dream than does the e-book version.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>An <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/e-reader/">e-reader</a> that contains <em>all</em> the textbooks you need.</strong> This e-reader needs to let you easily bookmark important pages, highlight passages, take notes in the margins.  It needs to work across devices -- your smartphone, a <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/tablet/">tablet</a>, your laptop, a shared computer at the library.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>An app that lets you take notes in a variety of formats</strong> -- audio, video, writing.  It should let you snap photos of handwritten notes and, using OCR, make them searchable.  (Example:  <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a>)</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>An app that lets you find the cheapest possible textbooks</strong> -- whether they're found online or in brick-and-mortar stores, whether they're e-books or printed ones.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>A To Do app that easily and automatically syncs with your classes' assignments</strong>.  Bonus points if it sends you a push notification/reminder 1 week, 3 days, and 6 hours before class.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>An app that proofreads your term papers</strong>.  (Example:  <a href="http://kibin.com/">Kibin</a>)</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>A Gmail Labs feature (or something along those lines) that admonishes you when you go to email a professor a term paper and you haven't followed her or his <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/naming-conventions-good-for-faculty-and-students-alike/35467">naming conventions</a> for the assignment</strong>.  Trust me, your professors will thank you.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Any free app that saves you potentially hundreds of dollars off of hardware or software purchases.</strong> (Example:  the <a href="http://desmos.com/calculator/">Desmos</a> graphing calculator; <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>)</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>A better course and professor recommendation system</strong> other than the often shallow and mean-spirited <a href="http://ratemyprofessors.com">RateMyProfessors.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>A map of the library (and/or local coffee shop) that highlights the best places to work -- free WiFi and convenient power plugs.</strong> Bonus points if the app can indicate whether or not someone is already sitting there.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> <strong>All apps must work across multiple devices, as well as on- and offline.</strong></p>
<p>Your turn!  Let's hear what would be on your wish-list for back-to-school apps, students.</p>
