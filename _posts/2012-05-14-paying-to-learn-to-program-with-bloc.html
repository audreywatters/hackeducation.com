<h2 id="whypaytolearntocode">Why pay to learn to code?</h2>
<p>With the explosion in the availability of free material online that can help you learn to code &ndash; <a href="http://udacity.com">Udacity</a>, <a href="http://coursera.com">Coursera</a>, <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and the like &ndash; why pay for a computer science class?</p>
<p>Sometimes paying is necessary in order to earn college credits. There&rsquo;s also a belief &ndash; right or wrong &ndash; that courses that charge tuition are better than ones offered for free. In part it&rsquo;s the old &ldquo;you get what you pay for adage&rdquo;; but it&rsquo;s also the presumption that formal education (and the credentials that come with it, of course) trumps the informal &ndash; not just because the education is supposedly better but because of the status afforded to and by institutions.</p>
<p>Many of the new learn-to-code-online resources insist that they provide a high quality, university-level education for free. In other words, their free classes are just as good as those you pay for.</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;ve noted based on <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/5-things-ive-learned-moocs-about-how-i-learn">my own experiences</a> with several of them, the quality of the materials and the instructor is just part of what makes a class &ldquo;good&rdquo; (for me at least). And as such, I ask: how do these free learn-to-code sites work to support learners, individually or as a community? How do they help learners succeed? &ldquo;Success&rdquo; can mean lots of things, no doubt, but let&rsquo;s say here it means that those who enroll will achieve their personal learning goals. Of course, it&rsquo;s fair to ask how much learners are really supported when they pay for courses. But with free online classes there seems to be an expectation that the <a href="/2012/04/14/udacity-cs101/">attrition rate</a> will be high. Most won&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>What obligations do learning institutions and companies have to their students to support them? And is &ldquo;support&rdquo; something (or another thing) that would make paying for a course worth it?</p>

<p>I have been stewing about a lot of these questions in light of a recent pivot by the learn-to-code startup <a href="http://www.bloc.io">Bloc</a>. Bloc has gone from a free browser-based guide that taught people web-development and app deployment to an eight-week online developer boot camp &ndash; one that costs $3000 and has a fairly rigorous application process.</p>
