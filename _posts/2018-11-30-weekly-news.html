<p><em>Each week, I gather a wide variety of links to education and education technology articles. All this feeds the review I write each December on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the stories we are told</a> about the future of education. But I&#8217;m putting that project on pause while I write my book. So you can start counting down the number of times you&#8217;ll have to wade through this depressing list of education- and tech-related stories.</em></p>

Landry College Prep</strong> looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;the school falsified transcripts, made up student accomplishments and mined the worst stereotypes of black America to manufacture up-from-hardship tales that it sold to Ivy League schools hungry for diversity. The Landrys also fostered a culture of fear with physical and emotional abuse, students and teachers said. Students were forced to kneel on rice, rocks and hot pavement, and were choked, yelled at and berated. </p>
