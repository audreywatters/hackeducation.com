<h2>This Week in Standardized Testing</h2>
<p><strong>PISA</strong> has released the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results-volume-v.htm">latest scores</a> from its 2012 &ldquo;creative problem-solving&rdquo; assessments. <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2014/04/pisa_problem_solving.html">US students didn&rsquo;t suck, performing above average</a>. NewSchool Venture Fund&rsquo;s Benjamin Riley <a href="http://kuranga.tumblr.com/post/81522914447/21st-century-problems-and-pisa-is-one">responds</a> with a raised eyebrow about what the test actually measures. (It goes to show that no matter the score, no matter the subject, some folks get all worked up while others just <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/rick_hess_straight_up/2014/04/pisas_problem-solving_results_are_interesting_but_thats_it.html">shrug</a> at the results. There's really no winning at this game.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Unprecedented&rsquo; numbers <strong>opt out</strong> of state tests," <a href="http://digital.hechingerreport.org/content/unprecedented-numbers-opt-state-tests-whats-next_1406/">writes Anya Kamenetz</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Persistent computer glitches with state tests have prompted officials to add two weeks to this year&rsquo;s testing period,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2014/03/30/4926356/kansas-education-officials-extend.html">reported the Kansas City Star</a> on Saturday. But by the end of the week, <strong>Kansas</strong>'s &ldquo;glitches&rdquo; had morphed into &ldquo;<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/04/kansas_suspends_state_tests_fo.html">cyber attacks</a>,&rdquo; and the state suspended the tests saying that it was being DDOS&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>There were <a href="http://nt.gmnews.com/news/2014-04-03/Front_Page/Pilot_exam_hits_some_glitches.html">glitches</a> in administering computer-based exams in <strong>New Jersey</strong>.</p>
<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>

<p>Following the lead of <strong>Indiana</strong>, other states are moving to back out of the <strong>Common Core</strong>. This week the <a href="http://kfor.com/2014/04/01/controversial-bill-dealing-with-common-core-passes-oklahoma-senate/"><strong>Oklahoma</strong> State Senate</a> passed a bill that would repeal the Common Core there. (A similar bill has also passed the Oklahoma State House, but differences in the two pieces of legislation will need to be resolved before this becomes law.)</p>
<p>Tea Party backers, the billionaire <strong>Koch Brothers</strong> are bankrolling academic programs at universities, <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/03/27/14497/inside-koch-brothers-campus-crusade">according to the Center for Public Integrity</a>.</p>
<p>Sir Michael Wilshaw, England's Chief Inspector of Schools, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/education-26853447">says</a> that the country&rsquo;s <strong>nursery schools</strong> aren&rsquo;t tough enough and aren&rsquo;t offering enough formal education.</p>
<h2>This Week in Censorship</h2>
<p>The school board of <strong>Idaho</strong>&rsquo;s Meridian School District has <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/04/02/3112930/meridian-keeps-book-off-shelves.html">voted</a> to remove Sherman Alexie&rsquo;s <em>The Absolutely True Story of a Part-Time Indian</em> from school shelves.</p>
<p>Today is 404 Day, an <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/03/404-day-day-action-against-censorship-libraries-and-schools">EFF action</a> to highlight <strong>Internet censorship</strong> in public schools and libraries.</p>
<h2>Ed-Tech Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p>We all know that cyberschool provider <strong>K12 Inc</strong> is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/education/online-schools-score-better-on-wall-street-than-in-classrooms.html">pretty terrible</a> (not everyone admits if, of course. But we all <em>know</em> it), with lousy education and business practices. So how you address a problem like that? <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/04/02/27rebrand_ep.h33.html">You rebrand</a>, of course. K12 Inc will now be <strong>Fuel Education</strong>.</p>
<p>New York State has <a href="http://www.lohud.com/story/news/education/2014/04/02/state-education-department-abandons-inbloom-data-sharing-plan/7204567/">pulled out of <strong>inBloom</strong></a> (which <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0414/morningeducation13487.html">according to Politico</a>, leaves the data infrastructure organization with no customers). While some are hailing this as a victory for student privacy, <a href="http://funnymonkey.com/blog/new-york-pulls-out-inbloom-ho-hum">Funnymonkey&rsquo;s Bill Fitzgerald notes</a> it&rsquo;s &ldquo;only good news for the other players in the space&rdquo; &ndash; players like Pearson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <strong>University of Florida</strong> will pay <strong>Pearson Embanet</strong> an estimated $186 million over the life of its 11-year contract &mdash; a combination of direct payments and a share of tuition revenue &mdash; to help launch and manage the state&rsquo;s first fully online, four-year degree program,&rdquo; reports <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20140327/ARTICLES/140329618/1182?p=all&amp;tc=pgall&amp;tc=ar">The Gainesville Sun</a>. <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/clarifications-uf-online-payments-pearson-embanet/">Phil Hill</a> clarifies some of the numbers.</p>
<p><strong>2U</strong> will <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/04/03/online-education-provider-2u-disband-semester-online-consortium">end</a> its Semester Online program, which offered a consortium of schools access to a shared pool of online undergraduate courses.</p>
<p>Nope, <strong>Harvard Library</strong>&rsquo;s copy of Juan Guti&eacute;rrez&rsquo; <em>Practicarum quaestionum circa leges regias Hispaniae</em> is <a href="http://etseq.law.harvard.edu/2014/04/852-rare-old-books-new-technologies-and-the-human-skin-book-at-hls/">not bound</a> in human skin, despite a story to that end that <a href="https://roadtrippers.com/blog/harvard-discovers-three-of-its-library-books-are-bound-in-human-flesh">went viral</a> this week.</p>
<h2>MOOCs and Other April Fools' Jokes</h2>
<p>Enterprise software company <strong>SAP</strong> is launching more MOOCs on its &ldquo;openSAP&rdquo; platform. From the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2139760/sap-wants-to-make-business-users-headoverheels-for-hana-with-new-mooc.html">press release</a>: &ldquo;Participants can learn about the latest technology and business trends directly from the market leader in business applications and enhance their understanding of how SAP solutions can help grow their business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>Sorbonne</strong> is launching MORCs &ndash; <a href="http://imt-sorbonne.fr/blog/morc-by-sorbonne-imt-master-x-parrot-2/">massive open robotic courses</a>, using Parrot drones. &ldquo;By melting robotics and teaching, the students will now be able to full advantage of all their educational opportunities whilst still living a student life.&rdquo; April Fools! Because <em>no one</em> wants to automate education (well, surely not the Sorbonne.)</p>
<p><a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V134/N15/mitx.html">A faculty committee at <strong>MIT</strong></a> is &ldquo;preparing to recommend a &lsquo;face-time&rsquo; degree requirement, strong oversight of on-campus MITx experiments, and a &lsquo;conservative initial approach&rsquo; to awarding credit for <strong>edX</strong> classes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>Taking Notes by Hand</strong> Benefits Recall, Researchers Find.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/taking-notes-by-hand-benefits-recall-researchers-find/51411">the headline</a>, but the research isn&rsquo;t actually published yet. So be sure to jot down a note so you can remember to look this study up later.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/nyregion/half-of-new-yorks-tech-workers-lack-college-degrees-report-says.html">Almost half</a> the jobs in <strong>New York City</strong>&rsquo;s tech sector are filled by folks without college degrees.</p>

<h2>This Week in Awesome College Admissions (and Awful Op-Ed Responses)</h2>

This is strictly OUSD.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Congratulations to 17 year old <strong>Kwasi Enin</strong> who was <a href="http://bit.ly/1fJt9EU">admitted</a> to all eight Ivy League schools &ndash; <strong>Harvard</strong>, <strong>Yale</strong>, <strong>Princeton</strong>, <strong>Columbia</strong>, <strong>Cornell</strong>, <strong>Dartmouth</strong>, the <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong> and <strong>Brown</strong>.</p>

Funny how we decide to stop celebrating achievement when it&rsquo;s young Black men who achieve.</p>
