<p>Two years ago today, I published <a href="/2010/06/05/why-hack-education/">my first blog post here</a> on Hack Education.</p>
<p>At the time, I was a technology blogger for <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a>, feeling intensely frustrated that I was admonished for wanting to write about ed-tech. &ldquo;No one cares,&rdquo; the editors said. &ldquo;Not enough pageviews.&rdquo; So I bought this domain and figured I&rsquo;d just cover the topic here.</p>
<p>In the past two years, I&rsquo;ve written 670-some-odd posts and according to Google Analytics, I&rsquo;ve had over 750,000 page views. Not too shabby for a brand new blog on a topic that nobody cares about by a writer that nobody knows.</p>

<h2>Thank you, readers</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled beyond belief that people have found me, whatever they&rsquo;ve searched for or clicked on to get here. I&rsquo;m thrilled people actually read this blog, because I love writing it. Despite the traffic (regardless of the traffic), this will remain a place for me to rant and rave; to stew and chew on learning theories, tools, and practices; to be contrarian, loud, and fearless.</p>
