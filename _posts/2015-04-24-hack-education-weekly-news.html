<p>&#8220;A California judge has denied a request for state intervention at six California high schools where students said they had been assigned to multiple contentless classes, were told to go home, or sit idly in classrooms or perform menial administrative tasks.&#8221; <a href="http://edsource.org/2015/judge-denies-motion-to-intervene-at-high-schools-accused-of-sham-courses/78650#.VTnktiHBzGc">More on the <em>Cruz v California</em> lawsuit here</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;A judge in Manhattan has ordered a hearing that will touch upon the continuing debate over whether caged chimpanzees can be considered &#8216;legal persons,&#8217; in the eyes of the law, and thus sue, with human help, for their freedom,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/nyregion/judge-orders-hearing-for-2-chimps-said-to-be-unlawfully-detained.html">The New York Times reports</a>.

Makaeff claimed she shelled out $60,000 for a real estate program that consisted of seminars that were little better than infomercials. Trump University countersued, accusing Makaeff of defaming it in online postings and elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
