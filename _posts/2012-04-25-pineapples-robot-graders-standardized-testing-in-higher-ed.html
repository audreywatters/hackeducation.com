<p><a title="Pineapple by smilygrl, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smilygrl/3242828710/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3255/3242828710_68baa551cb.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="500" height="375" /></a> <br />Just one day before <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/nyregion/standardized-testing-is-blamed-for-question-about-a-sleeveless-pineapple.html">Pineapple-gate</a> erupted, New York Times columnist David Brooks called for more standardized testing in higher education.
