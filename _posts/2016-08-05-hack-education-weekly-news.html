<p><a href="https://edsource.org/2016/report-charges-many-charter-schools-exclude-children-in-violation-of-the-law/567622">Via EdSource</a>: &#8220;Over 1 in 5 of <strong>California&#8217;s charter schools</strong> have <strong>restrictive admissions requirements</strong> or other exclusionary practices that keep out many students with the greatest academic needs, a report released Monday by the ACLU Foundation of Southern California and the public interest law firm Public Advocates alleges.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://kevanharris.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/wdobbie/files/texas_charters.pdf">Research by Roland Fryer and Will Dobbie</a>: &#8220;We estimate <strong>the impact of charter schools on early-life labor market outcomes</strong> using administrative data from Texas. We find that, at the mean, charter schools have no impact on test scores and a negative impact on earnings. No Excuses charter schools increase test scores and four-year college enrollment, but have a small and statistically insignificant impact on earnings, while other types of charter schools decrease test scores, four-year college enrollment, and earnings. Moving to school-level estimates, we find that charter schools that decrease test scores also tend to decrease earnings, while charter schools that increase test scores have no discernible impact on earnings.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://edtrust.org/resource/a-glimpse-inside-the-coffersendowment-spending-at-wealthy-colleges-and-universities/">According to a report from The Education Trust</a>, &#8220;roughly 3.6 percent of colleges and universities &#8211; 138 in all &#8211; held 75 percent of all postsecondary <strong>endowment</strong> wealth. Yet despite their vast wealth, too few of these colleges invest enough in students from low-income families.&#8221; Almost half of these schools are in the bottom 5% for enrolling first-time, full-time Pell Grant recipients. These colleges could use some of those endowment funds, Ed Trust contends, to better support <strong>low-income students</strong>.</p>

<p>One of education&#8217;s greatest luminaries passed away this week. <strong>Seymour Papert</strong> died at his home in Blue Hill, Maine on Monday. Papert, <a href="https://youtu.be/6-dFTmdX1kU">as Gary Stager has described him</a>, was the &#8220;inventor of everything (good) in education.&#8221; He developed &#8220;constructionism,&#8221; a theory of learning based on Jean Piaget&#8217;s &#8220;constructivism&#8221;; he co-invented the programming language LOGO; he was the inspiration for Lego&#8217;s Mindstorms; he co-founded the MIT Media Lab; he&#8217;s been called the father of the &#8220;maker&#8221; movement; he authored two books that everyone in education should read: <em>Mindstorms</em> and <em>The Children&#8217;s Machine</em> (he authored more than that, but you really must read these books, particularly if you work in ed-tech); and he was a mentor and friend to many. </p>
