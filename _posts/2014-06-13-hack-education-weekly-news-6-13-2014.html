<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p><a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-11/">What You Should Know This Week</a>: a California judge handed down a ruling in <strong><em>Vergara v California</em></strong>, delivering a blow to <strong>teachers&rsquo; unions</strong> in the state by overturning 5 laws that deal with <strong>tenure</strong> and <strong>seniority</strong>. I think every edu pundit and politician has weighed in by now. A few: <a href="http://takingnote.learningmatters.tv/?p=7032">John Merrow</a>, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/teachers-union-california-court-decision-107816.html">Stephanie Simon</a>, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/06/california-rules-teacher-tenure-laws-unconstitutional/372536/">Dana Goldstein</a>, <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118106/vergara-v-california-rules-against-teacher-tenure-california">Kevin Carey</a>, <a href="http://kuranga.tumblr.com/post/88397773191/quick-reaction-to-vergara-decision">Benjamin Riley</a>, <a href="http://www.aft.org/newspubs/press/2014/061014b.cfm">Randi Weingarten</a>, <a href="http://excelined.org/news/statement-jeb-bush-students-win-california/">Jeb Bush</a>.</p>
<p>Eileen DiNino of Reading, Pennsylvania <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/06/11/woman-dies-in-jail-because-she-failed-to">died in jail</a> where she was being held because she could not afford to pay the fines related to her children&rsquo;s <strong>truancy</strong>. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/05/20/314138887/unpaid-court-fees-land-the-poor-in-21st-century-debtors-prisons"><strong>Debtors&rsquo; prisons</strong>. Yes, we have them</a>.</p>
<p>The Second Circuit of the US Court of Appeals <a href="http://www.hathitrust.org/authors_guild_lawsuit_appeal_ruling">upheld</a> an earlier ruling in <strong><em>Author&rsquo;s Guild et al. vs HathiTrust et al</em></strong>, affirming that digitization for full-text search and access for print-disabled readers is <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>President Obama <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/student-loan-interest-cap-president-obama-107571.html">issued an executive order</a> to address <strong>student loan debt</strong> &ndash; capping repayments to 10% of borrowers&rsquo; income.</p>
<p>The US Senate <a href="http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/06/senate-votes-down-elizabeth-warrens-student-loan-bill/372579/">defeated a proposal</a> by Elizabeth Warren to allow borrowers to <strong>refinance their student loans</strong> at lower interest rates.</p>
<p>On the heels of an viral article in The Washington Post about &ldquo;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bill-gates-pulled-off-the-swift-common-core-revolution/2014/06/07/a830e32e-ec34-11e3-9f5c-9075d5508f0a_story.html">How <strong>Bill Gates</strong> Pulled Off the Swift Common Core Revolution</a>,&rdquo; the <a href="http://collegeready.gatesfoundation.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=wPhuLSxJgV4%3D&amp;portalid=0"><strong>Gates Foundation</strong> now says</a> we should slow down with teacher evaluation systems based on the <strong>Common Core</strong>. Let&rsquo;s see if <strong>philanthropy shapes policy</strong> here, eh?</p>
<p>President Obama unveiled a new portal for <strong>ConnectED</strong>, his <strong>E-rate</strong> project that aims to involve the tech sector in helping to boost schools&rsquo; and libraries&rsquo; Internet and tech capabilities. The program will have a new &ldquo;E-rate specialist,&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/06/obama_plans_hub_to_link_tech_c.html">reports Education Week</a>, which will be funded by the <strong>Broad Foundation</strong>. Because hey! Look! <strong>Philanthropy shapes policy</strong>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/business/fcc-chief-plans-action-on-wi-fi-in-schools.html">The New York Times has a puff piece</a> on the <strong>FCC</strong>&rsquo;s plans for better WiFi access in schools, with nary a mention of <strong>Net Neutrality</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-met-with-david-karp-at-the-white-house-2014-6">Obama invited <strong>Tumblr</strong> founder David Karp to the White House</a> this week, where we learned that his daughter Sasha has been violating the site&rsquo;s TOS (and <strong>COPPA</strong>) by using Tumblr before she turned 13. But hey, what&rsquo;s a little <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/aarons-law-violating-a-sites-terms-of-service-should-not-land-you-in-jail/267247/">violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> among friends, right?</p>
<p>The US House of Representatives has <a href="http://neatoday.org/2014/06/13/house-delays-vote-on-easing-school-meal-standards/">delayed voting</a> on a bill that would allow schools to opt out of <strong>nutritional standards in school lunches</strong>.</p>
<p>House Majority leader <strong>Eric Cantor</strong> (R-VA) was defeated in a primary race this week &ndash; normally not something I&rsquo;d report (even though Cantor has been a major supporter of charter schools and vouchers). But I guess this counts as &ldquo;education news&rdquo; as the candidates for his seat &ndash; Tea Party-backed Republican David Brat and his Democratic opponent Jack Trammell &ndash; are <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/06/11/professor-pulls-tea-partys-biggest-upset-year">both professors at <strong>Randolph Macon College</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>School Sports Team</h2>

(These classes required only writing a term paper, which was actually written by a tutor.)</p>
<p><strong>Julius Nyang&rsquo;oro</strong>, a former chair of the <strong>UNC</strong>&rsquo;s department of African and Afro-American studies, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/former-dept-chair-at-chapel-hill-to-cooperate-in-academic-fraud-probe/79337">will cooperate with an investigation</a> into academic fraud related to student athletes.</p>
<p>The <strong>class action lawsuit</strong> by student athletes against the <strong>NCAA</strong> started this week. <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2014/6/2/5759916/ncaa-ed-obannon-lawsuit-trial">A primer</a>.</p>
<h2>MOOCs and Other Online Endeavors</h2>
<p><a href="http://unizin.org/">Announcing Unizin</a>: &ldquo;<strong>Unizin</strong> is a strategic move by universities to assert greater control and influence over the digital-learning landscape than would otherwise be possible by any single institution." The four founding institutions are Colorado State University, Indiana University, the University of Florida, and the University of Michigan. <a href="http://unizin.org/2014/06/why-unizin/">Why Unizin?</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As professors and members of the academy, we want to support faculty and universities by ensuring that universities and their faculty stay in control of the content, data, relationships, and reputations that we create. As we look at the rapidly emerging infrastructure that enables digital learning, we want to bias things in the direction of open standards, interoperability, and scale. Unizin is about tipping the table in favor of the academy by collectively owning (buying, developing, and connecting) the essential infrastructure that enables digital learning on our campuses and beyond.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The platform for Unizin will be <strong>Instructure Canvas</strong>, because &rdquo;<a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/4-universities-band-together-to-share-and-protect-digital-resources/53269">banding together</a>" to resist outsourcing definitely starts with <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/06/12/unizin-common-infrastructure-means-commercial-software">a shared LMS</a> made by a third party vendor. Viva la resistance.</p>

<p><strong>The City College of San Francisco</strong> has <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/06/12/accreditors-possible-extension-city-college-san-francisco">won a reprieve</a> in its battle over <strong>accreditation</strong>, which was supposed to be revoked this summer. Now the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges has shifted its rules, making it possible for CCSF to keep its doors open &ndash; a move that isn&rsquo;t terribly surprising considering how politically charged this issue has become.</p>

<p><strong>The United Negro College Fund</strong> has received a $25 million gift from the <strong>Koch Brothers</strong>, which considering the Koch Brothers&rsquo; funding of the Tea Party movement and of voter ID (voter suppression) laws, is <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/06/09/uncf-receives-25m-koch-brothers-prompting-praise-and-anger">fairly controversial</a>.</p>
