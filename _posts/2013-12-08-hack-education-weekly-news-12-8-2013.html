<p><em>My apologies for the lateness and lightness of this post. But I&rsquo;ve been in Paris this past week and WiFi access has been tricky and the red wine abundant. I visited both La Porte d&rsquo;Enfer and Les Catacombes and I wish I could say I did so without thinking about ed-tech a single time.</em></p>
<h2>PISA!</h2>
<p>It was <strong>PISA</strong> week with the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/asian-countries-top-oecd-s-latest-pisa-survey-on-state-of-global-education.htm">release</a> of the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/03/key-pisa-test-results-for-u-s-students/">2012 scores</a> from the Program of International Student Assessment, an exam given to students around the world. In math, the average score of US students was 481, lower than the OECD average of 494. In science, the average score of US students was 497; the OECD average was 501. In reading, the average score of US students was 498; the OECD average was 496. <a href="http://zhaolearning.com/2013/12/02/reading-the-pisa-tea-leaves-who-is-responsible-for-finland%E2%80%99s-decline-and-the-asian-magic/">University of Oregon professor Yong Zhao weighs in</a> (well, lots of folks did, but I&rsquo;ll just link to him).</p>
<h2>Other Tests</h2>
<p>The school board in Huntsville, Alabama will offer students <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/04/school-district-to-pay-students-up-to-300-for-act-scores/">cash incentives</a> to do well on their <strong>ACT</strong> tests &ndash; up to $300.</p>
<p>A revised <strong>SAT</strong> will not come until 2016, <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/03/college-board-pushes-back-revised-sat-one-year">according to Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>College Board</strong>, <strong>edX</strong>, and <strong>Davidson College</strong> are teaming up to offer special Advanced Placement courses in calculus, physics and macroeconomics. More details in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/education/professors-in-deal-to-design-online-lessons-for-ap-classes.html?_r=0">The New York Times</a>.</p>
<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p>There have been a wave of <strong>occupations</strong>, protesting against privatization efforts at several British universities. <a href="http://studentactivism.net/2013/12/02/a-new-wave-of-occupations-at-british-universities/">More via Angus Johnston</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/05/students-protests-police-repression-university-of-london">The Guardian</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Consumer Finance Protection Bureau</strong> will <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/after-years-of-troubles-largest-student-loan-servicers-get-stepped-up-overs">soon</a> have some oversight powers over <strong>student loan</strong> servicers like Sallie Mae. While the CFPB regulates bank-based loans, student loans haven&rsquo;t had the same oversight.</p>
<p>Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Representatives Joe Barton (R-TX) and Bobby Rush (D-IL) have <a href="http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/278028/advertising+marketing+branding/Senator+Markey+And+Representative+Barton+Reintroduce+Do+Not+Track+Kids+Act">reintroduced</a> the <strong>Do Not Track Kids Act</strong>, which would update <strong>COPPA</strong> to further restrict Internet companies from collecting and selling kids&rsquo; personal data.</p>
<p>Civil rights groups in Texas are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/06/texas-taser-students_n_4399674.html">asking</a> for a ban on using non-lethal weapons like <strong>Tasers</strong> and pepper spray on school grounds. This follows an incident last month where a student who was tased by a school safety officer suffered a traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p><strong>Utah</strong> State Senator Aaron Osmond (yes, from that family) <a href="http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/policy-buzz/1198-next-steps-for-choice-and-accountability-in-public-education">says</a> he plans to introduce a number of bills in the next legislative session, including one that will allow home school and private school students in the state to opt out of all public school requirements (including assessments) and one that will allow public school parents to influence the selection of their child&rsquo;s teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Argosy University</strong>&rsquo;s Denver campus has agreed to pay $3.3-million in a settlement with the Colorado attorney general&rsquo;s office, which found that the for-profit institution, a division of the Education Management Corporation, had intentionally misled students about one of its degree programs.&rdquo; <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/143457/">So says The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>.</p>
<p>A federal judge has <a href="http://m.chronicle.com/article/Former-Graduate-Students/143463/?cid=at&amp;utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en">dismissed</a> a lawsuit by a former graduate student at the <strong>University of Oregon</strong>. Monica Emeldi claimed that the school's education department retaliated after she complained about its treatment of women.</p>
<h2>Launches</h2>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong> CEO Jeff Bezos managed to distract from the company&rsquo;s woeful labor practices by announcing <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazons-jeff-bezos-looks-to-the-future/">via 60 Minutes</a> that it would soon launch drone delivery for Prime members. I&rsquo;m not even going to link to the folks who wrote about the ed-tech angle here.</p>
<p><strong>Boundless</strong>, the &ldquo;textbook alternative&rdquo; startup, has <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/blogs/inside-the-hive/2013/12/05/boundless-unveils-free-resources-for-teachers/Knp8bbIBULaOabFlgc9KUN/blog.html">launched</a> its Boundless Teaching Platform, an effort to get more teachers using and remixing Boundless content.</p>
<p><strong>littleBits</strong> <a href="http://littlebits.cc/new-members-of-the-littlebits-family">unveiled</a> several new modules this week: a microphone, a dc motor + motorMate, a vibration motor + vibeSnap, and a servo!</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Techcrunch speculated that <strong>Aardvark</strong> founder Max Ventilla&rsquo;s next startup would be an education one because his wife had tweeted a stack of education books that he was reading. Turns out, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/29/aardvark-founder-is-trying-to-turn-education-on-its-head-with-altschool/">Ventilla&rsquo;s launched a school</a>.
