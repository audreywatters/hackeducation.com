<h2>The End of Free at Flat World Knowledge</h2>
<p>News broke on Friday (via <a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/flat-world-knowledge-to-drop-free-access-to-textbooks/40780">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, reporting on a blurb from the National Association of College Stores&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nacs.org/campusmarketplace/110212.html">newsletter</a>) that the open textbook publisher <a href="http://flatworldknowledge.com">Flat World Knowledge</a> would be ending access to free versions of its textbook as of the new year.</p>
<p>The publishing company was founded in 2007 as the first commercial provider of open textbooks. These textbooks were available &mdash; for a fee &mdash; in print, digital (ePUB and PDF), and audio formats. But (up &rsquo;til now) students could always access the entire Flat World Knowledge catalog for free via the Web. According to figures cited by David Wiley at <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/03/09/sxswedu-storified/">SXSWedu</a> last year, about 35% of Flat World Knowledge&rsquo;s users did opt to buy a printed version. But CEO and co-founder Jeff Shelstad told <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/11/05/flat-worlds-shift-gears-and-what-it-means-open-textbook-publishing">Inside Higher Ed</a> that &ldquo;&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t convert [from free to paid] as much as we used to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that there&rsquo;s already been a lot of ink spilled (<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=flat%20world%20knowledge&amp;src=typd">tweets tweeted</a>, what have you) since this story broke. (See: <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2585">David Wiley</a>, <a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.ca/2012/11/predators-and-producers-whither-flat.html">Stephen Downes</a>, <a href="http://cain.blogspot.com/2012/11/flat-world-knowledge-falls-flat.html">Geoff Cain</a>, <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/11/05/a-revolution-deflated-open-source-book-company-flat-world-knowledge-starts-charging/">Pando Daily</a>.) Flat World Knowledge has long been hailed as a darling in open education and in ed-tech circles by taking on the powerful incumbants of the textbook industry with a new licensing and new business model.</p>
<p>Flat World Knowledge also took on some $26.2 million in venture capital, according to <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/flat-world-knowledge">Crunchbase</a>, from investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, GSA Venture Partners, and Random House.</p>
<p>As David Wiley suggests, it seems that the company&rsquo;s board of directors (which is comprised in part of its VCs) &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t have the patience to stay the course,&rdquo; opting to axe the free textbooks rather than &mdash; Wiley&rsquo;s suggestion &mdash; adjust the Creative Commons licensing so that the FWK books were amenable to the new open textbook initiatives in California and British Columbia. The latter are CC-BY while Flat World Knowledge&rsquo;s books have been &mdash; up &rsquo;til now at least &mdash; CC-BY-NC-SA. Of course it&rsquo;s not clear if they will or can remain openly licensed at all.</p>
<h2>2012: The Year of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Open Textbook</span> MOOC</h2>
<p>All told, it&rsquo;s been a pretty interesting year for digital textbooks, openly licensed or not. I&rsquo;m on the cusp of kicking off my &ldquo;Year in Ed-Tech&rdquo; series in the next few weeks, and digital textbooks will certainly be one of the trends I examine. A quick recap: 2012 has seen a digital textbook announcement by Apple, open textbook initiatives in California and British Columbia, a lawsuit against the open textbook startup Boundless, and plenty of proclamations by federal and state government officials alike that it&rsquo;s time to ditch the old paper copies.</p>
<p>But even with all the supposed changes to textbook publishing &mdash; from established companies, by startups, through government proclamations, via hackathons &mdash; it doesn&rsquo;t appear that things have changed fast enough. Not fast enough for a company like Flat World Knowledge to maintain its old business model having raised some $26 million in investment. And not fast enough to keep up with the changing ways in which the Internet can deliver educational content, <em>and deliver it free and openly</em>.</p>
<p>After all The New York Times just crowned 2012 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html">the year of the MOOC</a>, not the year of the digital textbook.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting here that the &ldquo;open&rdquo; in many of these new MOOCs simply means &ldquo;open enrollment&rdquo; and doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;open educational resources,&rdquo; something that prompted Creative Commons&rsquo; Timothy Vollmer to pen a call to &ldquo;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34852">keep MOOCs open</a>&rdquo; &mdash; freely accessibly <em>and</em> openly licensed.</p>
<h2>Open Education and Venture Capital</h2>
<p>Much like Flat World Knowledge, two of these new MOOC startups have raised substantial venture capital: some $22 million for <a href="http://coursera.com">Coursera</a> and $15 million for <a href="http://udacity.com">Udacity</a>. The funding&rsquo;s still fresh, and so it&rsquo;s too early to tell not only what these companies&rsquo; business models will be or if their VCs will have to step in at some point down the road and insist that, in order to increase revenue, that &ldquo;free and open&rdquo; become &ldquo;commercialized and closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I think we should ask nonetheless: what role do we want VCs to have in financing open access to education?</p>
<p>What can we -- teachers and learners -- expect in return?</p>
<p>Can these projects &mdash; free and openly licensed &mdash; be reconciled with VCs&rsquo; need for a return on investment? Maybe.</p>
<p>A better model to follow for these efforts &mdash; better than the investment or business models of traditional publishers or for-profit universities &mdash; might be open source technologies. (See Stephen Downes&rsquo; formulation of &ldquo;<a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2012/11/predators-and-producers-whither-flat.html">predatation versus production</a>.&rdquo; See also Tim O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/timoreilly/the-clothesline-paradox-and-the-sharing-economy-pdf-with-notes-13685423">The Clothesline Paradox and the Sharing Economy</a>.&rdquo;) Many companies that offer open source technologies (including Automattic&rsquo;s WordPress and Cloudera&rsquo;s Hadoop) charge for premium services. But the code remains free and open, entrusted to the community. There it cannot be sealed back up behind closed doors like we&rsquo;re about to see happen with Flat World Knowledge&rsquo;s textbooks and like I fear we may eventually see with some of these MOOCs.</p>
