<p><a title="But I swear... it was in selfdefence. by Nephelim (www.nerobizzarro.com), on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nephelim/5555879706/"><img style="margin: 15px;" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5296/5555879706_f251e5392a_n.jpg" alt="But I swear... it was in selfdefence." width="215" height="320" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A number of initiatives and startups are hoping to offers ways to give people some sort of formal(ized) recognition for their informal learning &ndash; or at least for the skills they possess for which they don&rsquo;t have official diplomas or degrees. Among them: Mozilla&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://openbadges.org/en-US/">Open Badges</a>&nbsp;project, the social endorsement site&nbsp;<a href="http://skills.to/">Skills.to</a>, the soon-to-launch&nbsp;<a href="http://degreed.com/">Degreed</a>, and the open-to-the-public-just-today&nbsp;<a href="http://learningjar.com/">LearningJar</a>.</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of buzz about these in the tech industry in particular -- due to the high demand for workers with programming skills, due to the feeling that a college degree in CS doesn't always mean someone has those necessary programming skills, and -- of course -- due to the concerns over the high cost of higher education. And even if there weren&rsquo;t headlines and hand-wringing about the &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/10/peter-thiel-were-in-a-bubble-and-its-not-the-internet-its-higher-education/">higher education bubble</a>," these efforts do make sense: a college degree isn&rsquo;t necessarily the best or only indicator of a person&rsquo;s skill-set.</p>
<p>But a&nbsp;<a href="http://cew.georgetown.edu/certificates/">report</a>&nbsp;released last month by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce has been weighing on me as I&rsquo;ve thought about the promise and potential for creating alternative forms of certification that would benefit more people more broadly.</p>
