<p>I was supposed to spend 2014 finishing my first book <em>Teaching Machines</em>. But that didn&rsquo;t happen. It didn&rsquo;t happen for a lot of reasons, many of which have to do with the economic realities of being a woman outside of academia, outside of mainstream journalism writing about ed-tech. Strangely, I don&rsquo;t get offered big book deals.</p>
<p>Instead I spent much of 2014 on the road, traveling and speaking extensively about ed-tech&rsquo;s histories, ideologies, and mythologies. People will pay you to keynote, I&rsquo;ve learned, (or at least, they'll pay your travel expenses) even if you insist that you're a writer, not a speaker.</p>
<p>So I wrote, and then I read aloud.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/frankenstein.png" alt="" align="right" />And somewhere along the way I realized that, while I hadn&rsquo;t finished <em>Teaching Machines</em>, I&rsquo;d actually written something else. A different book. I&rsquo;d written it piece by piece, keynote by keynote, lecture by lecture, chapter by chapter. And so I&rsquo;ve pulled it all together in a self-published book.</p>
<p><em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em> is a collection of fourteen of my talks on topics ranging from teaching machines to convivial tools, from ed-tech mansplaining to information justice.</p>
