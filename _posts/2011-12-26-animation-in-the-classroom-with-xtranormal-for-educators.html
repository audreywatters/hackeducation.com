<p><em>(Sometimes I get requests to review products, and I find I just don't have a lot to say.  There's not a particularly compelling story; there's not a particularly compelling usage for teaching or learning.  This is probably one of those cases.  But hey, I made a video.  And I wrote this blog entry to substantiate my posting it here.)</em></p>
<p>It was hard to not love the animation-making tool <a href="http://www.xtranormal.com/">Xtranormal</a>, in no small part because it burst onto the scene with some hilarious (and often NSFW) user-made movies.  (The famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL7yD-0pqZg">iPhone 4 versus Android Evo</a> is a good example, although one of my favorites admittedly was about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obTNwPJvOI8">getting a PhD in the humanities</a>).</p>
<p>Initially a free tool, Xtranormal began charging late last year, with business plans that cost up to $50 a month, a price way out of reach for most classroom teachers everyone. There was some pushback to the new pricing plan, in part because I think a lot of students and teachers had found the Xtranormal movie-making tool incredibly easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/10/29/weekly-ed-tech-roundup/">late October this year</a> the company launched a new "<a href="http://xtranormal.zendesk.com/entries/20566123-xtranormal-for-educators-an-announcement">Xtranormal for Educators</a>" platform. The price is cheaper -- $10 a month for the teacher account, with a $.50 per student charge.  At that price, you get student access to the animation-creation tool, and the movies be administered and/or graded by the teacher, with controls too over privacy and moderation.</p>
<p>Is it worth it?  I don't know.  I mean, if a teacher has 30 students, that's an additional $15 per month. Imagine having 3 classes of 30 and the costs quickly add up.  I suppose, you could just pay for a month of the service.  Make your videos.  Download your copies.</p>
<p>But making these animations with Xtranormal is pretty fun, I will definitely give you that -- and it's a good exercise not just in script-writing but in staging:  camera movement, camera placement, and direction.  The tool is easy-to-use, although admittedly it was challenging for me to make a demo movie without being a wee bit foul-mouthed.  Go figure.</p>
