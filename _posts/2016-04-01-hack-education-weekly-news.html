<p><a href="http://mgafrica.com/article/2016-03-31-liberia-plans-to-outsource-its-entire-education-system-to-a-private-company-why-this-is-a-very-big-deal-and-africa-should-pay-attention">Via the Mail and Guardian Africa</a>: &#8220;An Africa first! Liberia outsources entire education system to a private American firm. Why all should pay attention.&#8221; The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Kishore Singh, has <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201603280584.html">said</a> that &#8220;Such arrangements are a blatant violation of Liberia&#8217;s international obligations under the right to education, and have no justification under Liberia&#8217;s constitution.&#8221; The company in question is Bridge International Academies, which has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bridge-international-academies#/entity">received funding</a> from the Gates Foundation, Learn Capital, and Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s investment company the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (among others).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bridge&#8217;s model is &#8216;school in a box&#8217; &#8211; a highly structured, technology-driven model that relies on teachers reading standardised lessons from hand-held tablet computers. Bridge hires education experts to script the lessons, but the teacher&#8217;s role is to deliver that content to the class. This allows Bridge to hold down costs because it can hire teachers who don’t have college degrees – a teacher is only required to go through a five-week training programme on how to read and deliver the script.</p>
<br />
<p>To keep tuition costs low &#8211; about $6 a term &#8211;Bridge depends on large class sizes. An ideal class size is 40 to 50 pupils, but the classes can get upward of 70 students. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Families must pay that tuition &#8211; this isn&#8217;t free public education &#8211; and the cost is wildly prohibitive for most. Moreover, outsourcing to scripted lesson delivery does not build the capacity &#8211; in terms of infrastructure or human resources &#8211; that a struggling African nation might need. Simply saying <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-03-29-critics-emerge-as-liberia-hands-over-elementary-education-to-bridge-international-academies">&#8220;Critics emerge&#8221;</a> in response?

<p>Seventy-five percent of job ads for those roles at technology companies specify an educational requirement, compared with 58% of openings posted by the full universe of employers that are hiring software developers, according to Burning Glass Technologies, a labor-market data firm that analyzed 1.6 million ads for software-developer jobs nationwide. And in 95% of the tech-sector job ads that list a minimum credential, the employer calls for a bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher, versus 92% of the ads from all employers seeking developers. &#8230; Nationally, 68% of adults over age 25 don&#8217;t have bachelor&#8217;s degrees. Burning Glass found <strong>employers in Silicon Valley were the most exacting in terms of credentials, listing education requirements in 77% of developer job postings, and in those ads, demanding a bachelor&#8217;s or advanced degree 98% of the time</strong>.
