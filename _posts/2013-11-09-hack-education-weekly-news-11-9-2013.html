<h2>Election Day Results</h2>
<p>Tuesday was <strong>Election Day</strong> across the US. Among the results:</p>
<p><strong>Bill De Blasio</strong> was elected mayor of <strong>New York City</strong>. He <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/de-blasio-aims-to-reverse-education-policies-in-new-york/2013/11/08/5de6d24c-47f2-11e3-b6f8-3782ff6cb769_story.html">vows</a> to reverse many of Mayor Bloomberg&rsquo;s education policies.</p>
<p><strong>Amendment 66</strong>, a tax hike measure in <strong>Colorado</strong> that would have raised some $1 billion for education, was <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24461186/colorado-tax-school-finance-amendment-66-rejected">rejected</a>.</p>
<p>Voters in Katy, <strong>Texas</strong> said &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/05/texas-voters-70m-for-high-school-football-stadium">no</a>&rdquo; to a $70 million bond package to build a new high school football stadium. (How un-American&hellip; or un-Texan, rather.)</p>
<p>More on how the election results will impact higher ed <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/05/impact-2013-elections-higher-education">here</a> and how they&rsquo;ll affect K&ndash;12 <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2013/11/what_do_tuesdays_state_and_loc.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Other Education Politics</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The <strong>Jeffco</strong> school board voted unanimously Thursday night to scrap plans to test and implement the <strong>inBloom</strong> system for storing student information,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.columbinecourier.com/content/school-board-votes-scrap-inbloom-pilot">reports the Columbine Courier</a>. It&rsquo;s the latest in a long string of districts pulling out of the inBloom data initiative. So when <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/11/06/11partnershipside.h33.html">Education Week has a headline</a> that says &ldquo;Startups See InBloom as Appealing Partner,&rdquo; you really gotta wonder.</p>
<p>The <strong>Department of Education </strong><a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-education-department-announces-first-its-kind-resolution-virtual-charter-scho">announced</a> the &ldquo;first of its kind&rdquo; resolution of a civil rights investigation into a <strong>virtual charter school</strong>: an agreement with <strong>Virtual Community School of Ohio</strong> to ensure compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act for students with disabilities at the school."</p>
<p>The <strong>Army</strong> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/us/army-suspends-rotc-closings-at-13-universities.html">changed its mind</a> about shuttering <strong>ROTC</strong> programs at 13 universities, opting instead to put these programs on probation.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois Governor Pat Quinn</strong> has <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-08/news/chi-governor-quinn-paul-vallas-running-mate-20131108_1_running-mate-quinn-spokeswoman-brooke-anderson-governor-and-lieutenant-governor">named</a> <strong>Paul Vallas</strong> as his running mate for 2014. Vallas was once the head of the Chicago Public Schools and was most recently named the superintendent in Bridgeport, Connecticut -- that is, until a court decided that he didn&rsquo;t have the qualifications for the job. It&rsquo;s not clear if Vallas has the residency qualifications to be Quinn's running mate either.</p>
<h2>The Law</h2>
<p><strong>LAUSD</strong> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-teacher-rating-release-20131107,0,3985126.story#axzz2k3uE1zR1">lost</a> the latest round in its legal battle with The LA Times. The newspaper has sought access to teacher ratings via a public information request, but the district has withheld the information citing employee privacy. The district could still appeal this latest decision to the California Supreme Court.</p>
<p>A <strong>Pennsylvania School District</strong> is asking the Supreme Court to <a href="http://legalclips.nsba.org/2013/11/04/pennsylvania-district-asks-supreme-court-to-review-3rd-circuits-ruling-in-i-%E2%99%A5-boobies-case/">weigh in</a> on whether it can ban &rdquo;I &hearts; boobies&rdquo; cancer awareness bracelets or if doing so violates students&rsquo; First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>A summer course at the <strong>University of New Hampshire</strong> that teaches 4th thru 8th graders literacy skills has <a href="http://www.wmur.com/news/nh-news/unh-harry-potter-course-draws-letter-from-lawyers/-/9857858/22838158/-/qdne1o/-/index.html">received</a> a cease-and-desist letter from <strong>Warner Bros</strong>. The class is called &ldquo;<strong>Harry Potter</strong> as Storytelling,&rdquo; but the film studio objects.</p>
<p><strong>Higher One</strong>, a company that hawks debit cards to students on college campuses, has reached a &ldquo;preliminary agreement to pay $15 million to settle claims that its fees and marketing practices were predatory.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/06/higher-one-agrees-15-million-settlement-resolve-charges-over-fees">More via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<h2>Product Launches and Partnerships</h2>
<p><strong>Google</strong> has launched a new initiative called <a href="http://connectedclassrooms.withgoogle.com/">Connected Classrooms</a>, offering &ldquo;virtual field trips&rdquo; via Hangouts (well, live video events is probably a more accurate way to describe these.)</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> has also launched Helpouts, a video tutorial service. More details <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20131104/google-launches-helpouts-a-live-video-tutorial-service/">via AllThingsD</a>. Among the early adopters: <a href="http://www.edukwest.com/coursera-rosetta-stone-alliance-francaise-google-helpouts/">Coursera and Rosetta Stone</a>.</p>
<p>And in other <strong>Google</strong> news, folks have been speculating about what's going on on barges floating off the coast of San Francisco and Portland, Maine. A floating data center? Party boats for Sergei? A launch pad for Skynet? Turns out, the barges are new &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/06/google-barge-mystery-solved-interactive-learning-center">interactive learning centers</a>&rdquo; where the company will send folks to learn about new Google technologies. Still sounds completely creepy and exploitative to me. But I&rsquo;m sure all you Google Glass wearers will gladly be shipped there first for your indoctrination.</p>
<p><strong>Khan Academy</strong> and <strong>Getty Museum</strong> are <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/66289527869/getty-museum-partners-with-khan-academy-to-bring-art">partnering</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson</strong> <a href="http://www.pearson.com/news/2013/november/financial-times-givesstudentsopenaccesstoitsawardwinningcontento.html">announced</a> that it&rsquo;s giving students free access to the <strong>Financial Times</strong> through its API&hellip; 30 days after publication, that is.</p>
<p>Baltimore-based ed-tech startup <strong>An Estuary</strong> has launched a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edsavr-collect-save-share/dbmmeflmfblomgcoenojhbdjjljchcni?hl=en-US">Chrome extension</a> called "edsavr" that makes it easier to collect and share resources through Edmodo, EduClipper, and its own tool Sanderling.</p>
<p>The <strong>Wikipedia Education Program</strong>, which has encouraged educators to have students contribute to Wikipedia as part of their coursework, is spinning out into its own non-profit, the <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/11/07/wiki-education-foundation/">Wiki Education Foundation</a>.</p>
<h2>MOOOOOOCs</h2>
<p>107 institutions, 5 million of students, and thousands of hype-filled headlines later, <strong>Coursera</strong> is <a href="https://www.coursera.org/about/jobs/o8XWXfwI">hiring</a> a Director of Teaching and Learning.</p>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> has also <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/66024610082/meet-john-ciancutti-and-tom-willerer-our-new-chief">hired</a> former Netflix-ers John Ciancutti and Tom Willerer as its Chief Product Officer and VP of Product Management. The two were involved in developing Netflix&rsquo;s movie recommendation system &ndash; so we can see where this MOOC train is headed: &ldquo;Because you signed up for but never completed X course, we recommend you sign up for and never complete Y.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s MOOC platform <strong>FutureLearn</strong> has announced <a href="http://about.futurelearn.com/news/futurelearn-adds-brand-new-free-courses-for-the-new-year/">new classes for the new year</a>.</p>
<p>Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan visited the <strong>edX</strong> offices this week to announce the launch of <strong><a href="https://www.edx.org/blog/moocs-arab-world/1285">Edraak</a></strong>, an Arabic language MOOC portal build on the edX platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/142783/">The Chronicle of Higher Education says</a> that <strong>Stanford</strong> is seeking to reclaim the MOOC brand. Because yup. At the end of the day, this whole MOOC BS seems to be about brands.</p>
<h2>Online, Elsewhere</h2>
<p><strong>2U</strong> has added <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2013/11/06/2u-adds-first-international-partners-semester-online">two new institutions</a> to its Semester Online program: <strong>Trinity Collge</strong> in Dublin and the <strong>University of Melbourne</strong>.</p>
<h2>Ye Olde Brick and Mortar</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_24460539/san-jose-state-departments-forced-cut-classes-spring"><strong>San Jose State</strong> told</a> departments this week &ndash; just days before registration for spring term started &ndash; that they needed to trim tens of thousands of dollars from their budgets and cut class offerings. <a href="http://www.insidebayarea.com/news/ci_24476899/san-jose-state-restores-classes-it-threatened-cut">Then the school changed its mind</a>, saying it was going to use infrastructure funds to make up the budget shortfall instead. Maybe someone should offer a MOOC on campus administration, or something.</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-future-school-ipads-20131104,0,7148089.story#axzz2jq33gvC5">A $1-billion plan</a> to put an <strong>iPad</strong> into the hands of every <strong>Los Angeles</strong> student and teacher could prove difficult to sustain financially after about three years, based on figures provided by the L.A. Unified School District.&rdquo; So far the LAUSD/iPad thing has been a roaring success, eh?</p>
<p>And in other <strong>iPad</strong> news, theft of the devices &ndash; from schools and from students directly &ndash; is becoming increasingly common, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/03/thieves-swipe-school-ipads/3418205/">reports USA Today</a>.</p>
<h2>Funding, IPOs and Acquisitions</h2>
<p>Late Friday afternoon, <strong>Intel</strong> <a href="http://blogs.intel.com/csr/2013/11/intel-education-welcomes-kno-to-the-family/">announced</a> that it had acquired the digital textbook app <strong>Kno</strong>. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Kno has <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kno">raised</a> over $73 million funding, $20 million of which came from Intel.</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304527504579172031193421794"><strong>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</strong> has filed</a> its plans for a $274 million IPO. Hop on that, investors. At $14 to $16 a share, it&rsquo;s cheaper than a textbook.</p>
<p><strong>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</strong> also made an <a href="http://www.hmhco.com/media-center/press-releases/2013/october/Choice%20Solutions">acquisition</a> this week, buying the education data company Choice Solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> has made a <a href="http://www.proquest.com/en-US/aboutus/pressroom/13/20131104a.shtml">minority investment</a> in the research management company <strong>ProQuest</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong> has acquired Espresso Education for an undisclosed sum. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.mheducation.com/about/news-room/mcgraw-hill-education-collaborates-university-pennsylvania-invest-education">link to the paywalled story</a> in the Financial Times, which oh hey! If you&rsquo;re a student you can access in 30 days time. (See above.) Thanks Pearson!</p>
<p><strong>McGraw-Hill</strong> is getting into the ed-tech accelerator game. Well, I mean, who isn&rsquo;t?! The textbook publisher is <a href="http://www.mheducation.com/about/news-room/mcgraw-hill-education-collaborates-university-pennsylvania-invest-education">investing</a> in EDSi, the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s new startup accelerator program.</p>
<p><strong>TabTale</strong>, an Israeli startup that makes interactive books and educational apps for kids, has <a href="http://tabtale.com/news/tabtale-secures-12-million-investment/">raised</a> $12 million in funding from Qualcomm Ventures and Magma Venture Partners.</p>
<p><a href="http://technode.com/2013/11/01/education-app-super-secured-tens-of-millions-yuan-in-series-b-funding/">Technode reports</a> that <strong>Super</strong>, a mobile app that lets university students download course information, has received &ldquo;tens of millions yuan in Series B funding from a consortium led by Sequoia Capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Ohio State University</strong> committed $50 million to a new and untested venture capital fund despite concerns raised by top officials, <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/11/ohio_states_50_million_investm.html">records show</a>.&rdquo; The fund was pitched to the university by Mark Kvamme, a close friend of then OSU president <strong>Gordon Gee</strong>. But nothing to see here&hellip; Move along.</p>
<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p>The salaries for <strong>university head coaches</strong> are <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/07/football-coach-salaries-10-percent-over-last-year-and-top-5-million">up 10%</a> over last year and up 90% from 2006. 70 coaches make more than $1 million a year. Because priorities. Screw you, adjunct instructors.</p>
<p><strong>Upstate Medical University</strong> President David Smith was on the verge of being named president of <strong>Penn State</strong> when <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/11/upstates_president_padded_his_pay_without_authorization_albany_paper_reports.html">news broke</a> that he&rsquo;s been padding his pay without state authorization.</p>
<h2>RIP</h2>
<p><a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/november/cliff-nass-obit-110413.html">RIP&nbsp;<strong>Cliff Nass</strong></a>, a Stanford professor of communications, who passed away unexpectedly last week. Nass was well-known for his work on human-computer interactions and on multitasking.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115393/common-core-standards-make-mockery-novels-complexity">A story in the New Republic highlights</a>&nbsp;more silliness emanating from the <strong>Common Core State Standards</strong> &ndash; this time, how the standards rate literature&rsquo;s complexity. The CCSS has adopted <strong>Lexiles</strong>, a rating system developed by the MetaMetrics corporation, to ascertain how challenging reading materials are. Apparently <em>Hunger Games</em> is more complex than the <em>Grapes of Wrath</em>; <em>Mr Popper&rsquo;s Penguins</em> is more complex than <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>; and <em>Slaughterhouse Five</em> has a fourth-grade reading level.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/">2013 National Assessment of Educational Progress</a> (<strong>NAEP</strong>) results were released this week &ndash; here are the results as an <a href="http://nationsreportcard.gov/subject/reading_math_2013/pdf/infographic.pdf">infographic</a>. Fourth and eighth grade students made small gains in reading and math. You may proceed with typical praise or condemnation of the results, depending on your politics, your state, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can We Improve Retention Rates by Giving Students Chocolates?&rdquo; asks McGraw-Hill&rsquo;s VP of Research <a href="http://alfredessa.com/2013/10/can-we-improve-retention-rates-by-giving-students-chocolates/">Alfred Essa</a>. Essa is the <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/06/researchers-cast-doubt-about-early-warning-systems-effect-retention">latest</a> to take a close look at claims made by <strong>Purdue University&rsquo;s Course Signals</strong> about student retention. Conclusion: chocolate is awesome. Also: &ldquo;the direct causality attributed to Course Signals is erroneous. In fact, the causation is the reverse of what is claimed. Students who take Course Signals courses are not more likely to graduate than non-Course Signals students (at least not directly and at the rates suggested), rather students who graduate are more likely to take Course Signals courses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>LMS</strong> market is &ldquo;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/08/market-forecast-predicts-major-growth-within-lms-industry">not dead yet</a>,&rdquo; and according to some data might triple in the next 5 years to $7.8 million. Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>Inc Magazine</strong> has listed its annual list of the 5000 fastest growing companies in the US. <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2013/10/fastest-growing_private_ed_companies_make_inc_5000_list.html">44 are education companies</a> &ndash; less than 1%. Wheee.</p>
<p>Investment research company <strong>CB Insights </strong>has <a href="http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/trends/industry-follow-on-investment-rate">made a list</a> of the &ldquo;best and worst industries for seeded tech startups by follow-on investment rates.&rdquo; Education is near the bottom.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/open_data_unlocking_innovation_and_performance_with_liquid_information">recent report</a> from <strong>McKinsey</strong>, <strong>open data</strong>&nbsp;in education could be worth up to $1.2 trillion. &ldquo;The largest potential benefit comes from using open data to improve instruction by identifying the most effective strategies and tools for teaching specific skills and knowledge.&rdquo; Another great example of how the adjective &ldquo;open&rdquo; now simply means &ldquo;open for business.&rdquo; Another great example too of how education markets are over-hyped (see the previous two news items).</p>
<p>According to a calculation made at the 10th annual <strong>Open Education</strong> conference this week, <strong>openly-licensed textbooks</strong> have <a href="https://twitter.com/beckpitt/status/398862285352865792">saved</a> students over $100,000,000.</p>
<p>A report from the non-profit Child Care Aware of America <a href="http://money.msn.com/saving-money-tips/post--child-care-more-costly-than-college">contends</a> that &ldquo;for about two-thirds of the country, average <strong>child care costs</strong> are higher than annual tuition and fees at a four-year public college in the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://edutechnica.com/2013/11/01/naming-your-lms/">A look</a> at the way in which schools use URLs for their <strong>LMSes</strong> finds that &ldquo;almost a full 30% of institutions link to the URL provided by their LMS vendor from their official .edu sites (eg: school.desire2learn.com). An additional 40% of institutions use the name of their LMS product directly in their LMS URL (eg: moodle.school.edu).&rdquo; Not such a smart idea if you plan to ever change vendors.</p>
<p>A report from Public Agenda contends that few adults use <strong>websites</strong> like the White House&rsquo;s College Scorecard to make their decisions about whether and where to attend school. More details <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/04/metrics-college-performance-dont-reach-adult-students">via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<h2>Competitions/Contests</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.bammyawards.com/index.php/component/content/article/1066">According to a long and confusing blog post</a>, the <strong>Bammy Awards</strong> &ndash; a red-carpeted gala event copying the entertainment industry award shows in order to recognize teachers &ndash; will be discontinued &ldquo;as we know it.&rdquo; Good riddance.</p>
<p>The finalists of the annual <strong>Dance Your PhD</strong> contest have been announced. You can vote for your favorite <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2013/11/dance-your-ph.d.-finalists-announced">here</a>.</p>
<p>One of my favorite academic quitters, <a href="http://pankisseskafka.com/2013/11/01/november-challenge-send-your-butt-to-a-search-committee/">Rebecca Schuman</a> (now an adjunct at the University of Missouri, St. Louis) has been running a contest that offers $100 to the first two people who include a photo of their butt as part of their portfolio &ndash; as &ldquo;evidence of teaching excellence&rdquo; to search committees. <a href="http://pankisseskafka.com/2013/11/04/buttscan-champion-crowned/">One #<strong>buttscan</strong> winner has already been chosen</a>.</p>
<h2>Help the Internet Archive</h2>
<p>The <strong>Internet Archive</strong> is <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2013/11/06/scanning-center-fire-please-help-rebuild/">seeking donations</a> to help it rebuild after a fire damaged its scanning center. Thankfully, no one was hurt in the fire and no data was lost. But the organization lost about $600,000 in scanning equipment.</p>
