<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 3 in my <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/">Top 10 Trends of 2014</a> series</em></p>
<p>One of the challenges of pulling together this year end series is that education technology doesn&rsquo;t break down neatly into ten separate trends. &ldquo;<a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/business.html">The Business of Ed-Tech</a>&rdquo; bleeds into the politics of ed-tech, for example.</p>

<p>The next few posts in this series really underscore this, as I discuss &ndash; broadly &ndash; the state of higher education with regards to education technology. It&rsquo;s hard to extract what happened this year into distinct trends. And it&rsquo;s hard to only talk about <em>ed-tech</em>. To do so, I fear, would lose much of the context of <em>why</em> education technology has such a powerful influence on the stories we told ourselves about colleges and universities in 2014. (The same applies for K&ndash;12, no doubt.)</p>
<p>It would be easy, I suppose, to invoke the decades old &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease">Baumol&rsquo;s cost disease</a>&rdquo; &ndash; plenty of folks do &ndash; to explain the problems that education faces in terms of costs and labor productivity. To frame things this way does make an emphasis on technology somewhat understandable &ndash; technology is meant to make things more efficient and less expensive. (Of course, we can debate whether or not it actually accomplishes this and why efficiency would be a goal in learning.)</p>

<p>The rising cost of higher education has been something I&rsquo;ve been tracking in my year-end posts since 2011 when Peter Thiel famously described all this as a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/13/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2011-the-higher-education-bubble">higher education bubble</a>.&rdquo; That is, the cost of higher education is overly inflated, and as such college isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-high-school-grads-decide-college-isnt-worth-it/">worth it</a>.&rdquo; This is a narrative Silicon Valley likes to tell, and it&rsquo;s one we continue to see see parroted in a number of high profile venues, including this year&rsquo;s documentary <em>Ivory Tower</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a story that is experienced by so many people &ndash; those of us burdened by student loans, those of us who are un- and underemployed, those of us who thought that if we went to college and got a degree that we&rsquo;d have access to a better life. It&rsquo;s a story we were told and we believed. And it&rsquo;s a story that, in today&rsquo;s economy, just doesn&rsquo;t hold true. Some <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/10/pf/college/student-loans/">40 million Americans</a> now have some student loan debt, and the amount of that debt debt continues to climb (and we&rsquo;re starting to recognize <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/08/05/how-student-loans-are-shaping-mortgage-approvals/">the ripple effect</a> that that has on the economy).</p>

<p>College tuition continues to increase. <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/">The pressure to <em>go</em> to college</a> grows as well.</p>
<p>But what does it mean to call higher education &ldquo;a bubble&rdquo;? How do we respond &ndash; culturally, politically?</p>
<p>You could respond by reading <a href="http://tressiemc.com/">all of Tressie McMillan Cottom&rsquo;s work</a>. No really, you <em>should</em> do that.</p>
<p>Instead, it seems as though one of the dominant responses involves a change in our expectations about what education is and what education does and what higher education &ndash; a credential &ndash; means.</p>
<p>Increasingly, education is reframed to be all about &ldquo;<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/23/startups-want-help-employers-find-students-they-can-hire">jobs</a>.&rdquo; Education is about &ldquo;skills&rdquo; (particularly &ldquo;job skills&rdquo;).</p>
<p>If you listen to the stories that industry tells about education &ndash; particularly the tales out of Silicon Valley &ndash; we&rsquo;re in the middle of a major &ldquo;<a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/201404/cait-murphy/skills-gap-in-the-labor-force.html">skills shortage</a>.&rdquo; Schools aren&rsquo;t training (the use of that word &ldquo;training&rdquo; is key) students correctly or adequately. And so, as the story goes, school must change. They must change to meet the needs of industry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s meant to be the theme of this post: &ldquo;skills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before I turn to it, I&rsquo;m going to provide a little more context for the state of higher education today. (Okay, a lot of context.) Much of this doesn&rsquo;t have to do directly with ed-tech. But it&rsquo;s context. And it matters.</p>
