<p>Five years ago today, I published my first post here on Hack Education. The origin story of the blog is one that I&#8217;ve told a lot &#8211; I was a tech blogger, editors didn&#8217;t want me to write about ed-tech, they couldn't stop me, blah blah blah. <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin</a> tells the story too, since we&#8217;d just started dating when we purchased the domains http://hackeducation.com and http://apievangelist.com. I&#8217;m amazed at what both of those sites, and by extension our lives, have become.</p>

<p>I realize that the traditional fifth anniversary gift is wood, but maybe you could consider something else. Remember: the work I do here is funded, in part, through the donations of readers. You can support my work via <a href="http://www.patreon.com/audreywatters">Patreon</a> or <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">Paypal</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you all for putting up with Hack Education for the past five years. Here&#8217;s to many more years of ed-tech doomsaying.</p>
