<h2>News Timed for Release at SXSWedu</h2>
<p>This past week was the fourth annual <a href="http://sxswedu.com/">SXSWedu</a> event in Austin. Speakers included Diane Ravitch, Texas State Senator (and gubernatorial candidate) Wendy Davis, Michelle Rhee, the College Board's David Coleman, Sal Khan, Chuck E. Cheese founder Nolan Bushnell, and <em>Arrested Development</em> actor Jeffrey Tambor. So a lot of WTF moments. Here is one investor&rsquo;s list of the <a href="http://gettingsmart.com/2014/03/110-interesting-edupreneurs-sxsw/">110 most interesting "edupreneurs"</a> present. And here's <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/03/07/sxswedu-2014/">my take</a> on the whole circus.</p>
<p>The <strong>College Board</strong> <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/145135/">announced</a> its plans for a redesigned <strong>SAT</strong>. Starting in 2016, the new SAT will have three sections: math, &ldquo;evidence-based&rdquo; reading and writing, and an essay. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/03/05/college-board-unveils-new-sat-major-overhaul-writing-exam">More via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p>On stage at the <strong>College Board</strong> announcement was Sal Khan as <strong>Khan Academy</strong> will now offer <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/sat">free SAT test prep</a>, arguing that this will enable a &ldquo;future determined by merit, not money.&rdquo; (As it currently stands, students whose parents have higher incomes score higher on the SAT.)</p>
<p>News Corp&rsquo;s education company <strong>Amplify</strong> released its new digital curriculum. I didn&rsquo;t get a preview, but I did get the kicker in <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/education/new-all-digital-curriculums-hope-to-ride-high-tech-push-in-schoolrooms.html">The New York Times article</a> on the release. So ha.</p>
<p><strong>McGraw-Hill</strong> <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/03/03/mcgraw-hill-education-intros-real-time-analytics-on-student-performance.aspx">unveiled</a> Connect Insight, &ldquo;a data analytics and visualization tool that provides at-a-glance views of student performance in real time via a tablet device.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2014/03/new-tools-for-schools-announced-at.html">announced</a> a couple of new Samsung Chromebooks and the availability of K&ndash;12 books in the Google Play store.</p>
<p>(Was that it? Nothing from last year's "darling,"&nbsp;<strong>inBloom</strong>? Nothing from the year before's "darling," <strong>Pearson</strong>?)</p>
<h2>Other Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p>The anti-plagiarism software company <strong>Turnitin</strong> has launched a new product Grade Anything. <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/03/07/turnitin-launches-grade-anything-for-assessing-virtually-any-assignment.aspx">According to Campus Technology</a>, it&rsquo;s a tool &ldquo;to assess &rdquo;virtually any type of assignement,&ldquo; including presentations, spreadsheets, designs and calculations, according to a company news release, and provides a grading template for assessing assignments such as performances and recitals.&rdquo; I wonder if Grade Anything makes the same sweeping copyright claims to student content that the essay-checking stuff does&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>edX</strong> <a href="https://www.edx.org/press/edx-announces-new-membership-structure">announced</a> that it&rsquo;s expanding its membership to Colgate University, Hamilton College, the OpenCourseWare Consortium, Osaka University, Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de Madrid, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Learning by Giving Foundation, The Linux Foundation, The Smithsonian, and Televisi&oacute;n Educativa. These organizations are not listed as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.edx.org/schools-partners">charter members</a>,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s not clear if this a path to monetizing MOOCs for edX.</p>
<p><strong>Mozilla</strong> has <a href="http://openbadges.tumblr.com/post/78764181250/announcing-mozilla-badgekit">launched</a> BadgeKit, a tool for the <strong>Open Badges</strong> ecosystem it's hoping to foster. BadgetKit&rsquo;s functionality includes support for creating and issuing badges and &ldquo;remixable templates and milestone badges allowing for easy customization.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Apollo Education Group</strong>, parent company of the <strong>University of Phoenix</strong>, has <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/u-of-phoenix-parent-company-launches-nontraditional-course-search/50855">launched</a> Balloon, a website that will help students &ldquo;find courses that teach skills they need to land specific jobs in the technology industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Spritz</strong>, a new reading app &ldquo;<a href="http://www.gizmag.com/spritz-speed-reading-galaxy-s5/31063/">gets words into your brain faster</a>.&rdquo; ORLY. Did anyone covering this launch talk to cog sci folks about this? Or was this just the tech-blogging-as-PR-wing-of-industry thing again?</p>

<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p><strong>President Obama</strong> announced his <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/obama-administration-2015-budget-prioritizes-key-education-investments-provide-o">2015 budget</a> this week, which includes money for a new initiative, Race to the Top-Equity and Opportunity. (Um, Obama. I don&rsquo;t think that word &ldquo;equity&rdquo; means what you think it means here.) There&rsquo;s also money for a ConnectEDucators program that would provide funding for tech-related PD.</p>
<p>The UK Department of Education website was <a href="http://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2014/03/05/hacked-dfe-website-hosts-article-declaring-39-gove-to-teach-all-children-himself-39.aspx">hacked</a> this week to read that "<strong>Michael Gove</strong> [education secretary] decides to teach all children himself&rdquo; in a giant classroom filled with 14 million school children.</p>

<p>The <strong>Kansas</strong> State Supreme Court ruled this week that the state&rsquo;s <strong>funding</strong> system violated the Kansas Constitution. More on the ruling in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/us/kansas-school-spending-ruling.html">The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>South Carolina</strong> House of Representatives has <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/03/01/south-carolina-legislature-con.html">axed</a> $52,000 funding from the College of Charleston for including Alison Bechdel&rsquo;s memoir about coming out, <em>Fun Home</em>, in its summer reading program.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Supreme Court</strong> heard testimony this week as to whether <strong>IQ</strong> and other standardized tests are sufficient to determine whether or not a death row inmate is eligible for execution. <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/high-court-looks-death-row-inmate-low-iq-0">According to the AP</a>, &ldquo;Five justices, enough to form a majority, pointed repeatedly to the margin of error inherent in IQ and other standardized tests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Australian student Andrew Farley will be <a href="http://www.thewire.com/global/2014/03/defamatory-tweets-about-teacher-cost-australian-student-100000/358843/">forced to pay</a> $100,000 after <strong>defaming</strong> a teacher on social media.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p>SRI International has finally released its research on the <a href="http://www.sri.com/work/projects/research-use-khan-academy-schools">use of <strong>Khan Academy</strong> in Schools</a>. (And do note, it said &ldquo;usage&rdquo; and not &ldquo;effectiveness,&rdquo; which was I totally thought the research was supposed to examine. But hey.) (<a href="http://www.sri.com/sites/default/files/publications/2014-03-07_implementation_briefing.pdf">PDF</a>) Research was conducted on Khan Academy implementations at 9 school sites, but as the report notes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;During the study, Khan Academy worked with schools participating in the study to update and refine its tools and resources. Simultaneously, teachers and students were using Khan Academy tools and resources in considerably different ways across the nine study sites, and some of the sites also changed the ways they used it during the course of the two-year study. For these reasons, it was methodologically unsound to conduct a rigorous evaluation of Khan Academy&rsquo;s impact on learning during the study period, including any use of randomized control trials, which would have required Khan Academy tools and resources to remain unchanged during the study and for teachers and students to use Khan Academy the same way. Moreover, at all but one of the sites, Khan Academy was principally used as a supplementary tool&mdash;not as the core primary curriculum&mdash;so the effects of Khan Academy cannot be separated from those contributed by other elements of the math curriculum.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s been lots of buzz about &ldquo;bite-sized learning&rdquo; recently, with apps touting small and quick content and assessment. So are shorter videos really better for learning? <strong>HarvardX</strong> researcher <strong>Justin Reich</strong> <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/edtechresearcher/2014/03/short_videos_are_better_for_learning_right_maybe_not.html">takes a closer look at the research</a>, particularly a recent study from edX that claimed that videos less than 6 minutes in length were best. But as Reich notes, &ldquo;best&rdquo; in this case meant &ldquo;engagement,&rdquo; and not necessarily &ldquo;learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>National Education Policy Center</strong> has <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/03/virtual_schools_continue_to_gr.html">analyzed</a> the enrollment in <strong>online virtual schools</strong> and has found that these schools &ldquo;serve a less-diverse population than public schools&rdquo; &ndash; fewer African-American and Hispanic students, for example, ad fewer special needs students.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2014022#.UxiMyiVhhXU.twitter">data</a> released by the National Center for Education Statistics, the <strong>technology infrastructure</strong> in more than 20% of US public schools is &ldquo;<a href="http://www.setda.org/2014/03/08/technology-infrastructure-in-more-than-20-of-u-s-public-schools-rated-inadequate/">inadequate</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Khan Academy</strong> has <a href="http://cs-blog.khanacademy.org/2014/03/challenge-completion-across-gender-and_4.html">released demographic data</a> about students who complete its CS material. Across all of Khan Academy, users are 48% female and 52% male; but when it comes to the CS content, 34% are female and 66% are male. 86.2% of males complete the first coding challenge; 86.7% of females complete the first coding challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Pew Research</strong> has released a report on &ldquo;<a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/">Millennials in Adulthood</a>.&rdquo; There are some interesting observations here (about these adults&rsquo; anti-institutionalism, for example). But it does call this group &ldquo;digital natives,&rdquo; so there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Bellwether Education Partners&rsquo; Andrew Rotherham <a href="http://www.eduwonk.com/2014/03/three-in-four-education-insiders-think-companies-are-operating-illegally-in-education-data-space.html">writes</a>, &ldquo;73 percent of the Education Insiders surveyed believe there are companies operating in the education sector in violation of federal privacy laws (83 percent see <strong>data privacy</strong> in education as a serious issue).&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.eduwonk.com/EducationInsiderFebMar2014.pdf">PDF</a>)</p>
<h2>School Sports Fail</h2>
<p>Allen ISD&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/02/28/what-cost-60-million-and-just-shut-down-this-texas-high-school-football-stadium/">Eagle Stadium</a>&nbsp;(in Dallas, <strong>Texas</strong>),&nbsp;a <strong>football</strong> stadium that cost some $60 million to build and just opened in August, will &ldquo;close indefinitely due to &lsquo;extensive cracking&rsquo; in the concourse as well as other potential structural problems.&rdquo; Go team.</p>
<h2>Spelling Bee Drama</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/03/epic-two-week-95-round-spelling-bee-finally-ends/358964/">epic spelling bee battle</a> in <strong>Kansas</strong> to determine who would move on to the <strong>Scripps National Spelling Bee</strong> ended today when Sophia Hoffman (age 11) misspelled a word and Kush Sharma (age 13) got the next one right. Sharma&rsquo;s win comes after 95 rounds and over two weeks.</p>
