<p>As I write this post, I realize: our podcast has no name yet.</p>
<p>Regardless, you should check out Steve Hargadon and my weekly podcast. We talk through the latest ed-tech news, and I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>You can listen to the MP3 below or you can subscribe to the podcast feed <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/edtechlive/hackeducation">here</a>.</p>
