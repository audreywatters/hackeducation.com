<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>Presidential candidate and clown Donald Trump &#8220;criticized the federal government for earning a profit on the federal student loan program,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/07/24/trump-slams-government-profits-student-loans">Inside Higher Ed reports</a>. (<a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/that-time-donald-trump-started-a-university-and-an-amazing-blog/102305">Remember that time</a> Trump ran a for-profit &#8220;university&#8221; that got fined by New York state because it wasn&#8217;t accredited and was making false claims? Good times.)</p>

<p>Defunct for-profit Corinthian Colleges has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/07/20/corinthian-colleges-donated-27000-boost-rubio">donated</a> over $27,000 to presidential candidate Marco Rubio&#8217;s various campaigns over the last five years.</p>

<p>&#8220;The U.S. Department of Education continues to work on its plan to grant experimental federal aid eligibility to partnerships between accredited colleges and alternative providers, such as job skills boot camps, coding academies and MOOCs,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/07/21/feds-mull-experiment-aid-and-accreditation-alternative-providers">Inside Higher Ed reports</a>. I bet the ed-tech industry is pretty stoked to have former VC Ted Mitchell there as the undersecretary of education, eh.</p>

<p>Oregon Governor Kate Brown has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/07/20/oregon-governor-signs-free-community-college-bill">signed legislation</a> creating a free community college program in the state.

<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/discover-fined-for-illegal-student-loan-practices#.rhyYwy9zY">Via Buzzfeed&#8217;s Molly Hensley-Clancy</a>: &#8220;One of the country&#8217;s largest private student loan servicers, Discover Bank, was fined $18.5 million Wednesday by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for a host of illegal practices. The action is Bureau&#8217;s first action against a student loan servicer, the latest step in the government&#8217;s attempts to ferret out bad practices by banks and nonprofits that service private student loans.&#8221; <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/student-loan-guarantor-wants-to-fine-students-for-default-ev#.ptOYBOr6Y">Hensley-Clancy also reports</a> on the bad practices of USA Funds: &#8220;A student loan guarantor run by a former Bush administration official has sued the Education Department for the right to impose thousands of dollars in fines on struggling borrowers who default on their student loans, but immediately make efforts to repay them.&#8221;</p>

(But I&#8217;m working on a story on how this sector is now co-opting the &#8220;everyone should learn to code&#8221; mantra and acquiring coding bootcamps. Boy, it'll sure help when financial aid is available for these, eh? Thanks, Department of Education!)</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, hardly a week would go by without the announcement of a new ed-tech startup incubator. The trend has died down a bit recently (I think &#8211; I&#8217;m not seeing as many headlines, at least). However, this week <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-07-24-southeast-asia-welcomes-two-new-education-technology-incubators">Edsurge notes</a> two new incubators in Southeast Asia: Topica EdTechLab in Hanoi and Lithan EdTech Accelerator in Singapore.</p>
