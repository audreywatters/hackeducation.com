<h2>Politics</h2>
<p><strong>Maine</strong>&rsquo;s Department of Education <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2013/04/27/news/state/state-awards-hewlett-packard-contract-for-school-laptop-program/">announced</a> that <strong>Hewlett Packard</strong> has been awarded the contract for the state&rsquo;s laptop program, making it the "<span>primary technology and learning solution</span>." Students will begin receiving their Hewlett Packard ProBook 4440s running Windows 8 in the fall (there will be some leeway to purchase others among the five finalists -- and Apple products, both the iPad and the MacBook are on that list -- although the price point of choice). <strong>Apple</strong> has had the exclusive contract to provide equipment for the state&rsquo;s one-to-one laptop program since 2002. I guess it&rsquo;s time to think different, or something.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota</strong> legislators have voted to end <strong>high-stakes testing</strong> in the state. Rather than tests that are required for graduation, the bill that passed the State Senate this week &ldquo;switches to a new testing system that is focused on career and college goals,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/blogs/204765211.html">reports the Star Tribune</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-brown-higher-ed-20130423,0,249490.story">The LA Times reports</a> that the state of <strong>California</strong> will adopt <strong>performance-based funding</strong> for its universities and colleges under a proposal that Governor Jerry Brown has drafted. The funding would tie budget increases to certain metrics, including graduation rates.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong> has approved new <strong>online-only degree programs</strong> to be offered through the University of Florida. The state, which already offers fully online K&ndash;12 education, is the first in the country to offer this via a public university. The courses will, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/22/us-usa-florida-education-idUSBRE93L1D220130422">according to Reuters</a>, &ldquo;cost no more than 75 percent of in-state tuition for regular classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://m.guardian.co.uk/education/2013/apr/22/lego-school-building-learning">The Guardian reports</a> that <strong>Lego</strong> will build its first-ever school in Billund, the Danish city where the corporation is headquartered. The school will focus on <strong>inquiry-based learning</strong>. The school &ldquo;is just one of a long line of projects in a town of 6,000 people sponsored by the Lego family. The family has also paid for an airport &ndash; the second largest in Denmark &ndash; and worked with the council to construct a church, community facilities, a library and a theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The state of <strong>Washington</strong> has passed and signed into law <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=1472">HB1472</a>, a bill that creates initiatives to &ldquo;improve and expand <strong>computer science</strong> education&rdquo; in the state. In part, the legislation will allow CS to count as a math or science requirement towards high school graduation.</p>

It also provides instructors with real-time information about student learning on a graphical dashboard display. In the last year or so, the start-up company has proved to be very popular, Mr. Mazur said. In fact, it was too popular for just three people to handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The student portfolio startup <strong>Seelio</strong> has raised $900,000 in seed funding, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/22/student-portfolio-site-seelio-raises-just-under-1-million-takes-its-platform-directly-to-educators/">reports Techcrunch</a>.</p>

<p>Research from the Community College Research Center at Columbia University&rsquo;s Teachers College has found that <strong>community college</strong> students prefer face-to-face classes over online ones, particularly for ones they think will be difficult, important, or interesting. More details on the study at <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/04/26/online-courses-are-second-choice-community-college-students-some-subject-areas">Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>

<p>Happy 20th birthday to the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">Mosaic browser</a></strong>&nbsp;&mdash; not the first Web browser, but arguably one that helped popularize the Web. Built at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, it&rsquo;s a excellent example of the innovations created by public universities.</p>
<p>I lost track of all the faculty this week who announced <strong>new jobs</strong> and/or <strong>promotions</strong>, after hearing updates from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.samplereality.com/2013/04/11/building-digital-studies-at-davidson/">Mark Sample</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/foundhistory/status/326782062772228096">Tom Scheinfeldt</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/2013/next-year-something-new-2/">Dave Parry</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/jmcclurken/status/326688213714468864">Jeff McClurken</a>. Bravo to them, and to those I missed.</p>
<p>President Obama honored the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://neatoday.org/2013/04/23/2013-teacher-of-the-year-jeff-charbonneau-honored-at-white-house/">Teacher of the Year</a></strong>&nbsp;at the White House this week &mdash; Zillah, Washington science teacher Jeff Charbonneau.</p>
<h2>Jeers</h2>
<p>Unbelievably ridiculous and awful news from Brian Kelly who&nbsp;<a href="https://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/my-redundancy-letter-arrived-today/">posted a picture</a>&nbsp;on his blog this of his redundancy letter, effective end of July. Kelly, along with 23 others at <strong>UKOLN</strong> (the&nbsp;UK Office for Library and Information Networking), have had their positions eliminated, thanks to budget cuts. UKOLN was established in 1989 and has been a leading force for innovative digital practices. I can't begin to express my thanks for all the hard work of Kelly and his peers have accomplished, nor can I really find the words to say how devastating this loss of expertise will be for open education.</p>
