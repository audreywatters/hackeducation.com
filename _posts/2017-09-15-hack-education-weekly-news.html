<p>US Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos launched a &#8220;rethink schools&#8221; tour. Here are some reports from her travels:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/us/2017/09/12/what-is-betsy-devoss-rethink-school-initiative-all-about-her-wyoming-speech-offers-clues/">Via Chalkbeat</a>: &#8220;What is <strong>Betsy DeVos</strong>&#8217;s &#8216;rethink school&#8217; initiative all about? Her <strong>Wyoming</strong> speech offers clues.&#8221;</p>

<p>DeVos visited my hometown of Casper, Wyoming to give this speech where she spoke at the Woods Learning Center. She was there to tout &#8220;choice,&#8221; something that she says most public school students and their families do not have. (This is part of her push for vouchers.) When I was growing up the building that now houses Woods was a school for students with special needs, including at one time, a school for deaf students. I&#8217;ve been thinking about the history of the language of &#8220;choice&#8221; and how &#8220;choice&#8221; and the lack of &#8220;choice&#8221; has been intertwined segregation and discrimination. That&#8217;s not the story that DeVos wants to tell, of course.)</p>

The proposal voted on is technically a ban on all centers and institutes engaging in litigation, but the only entity that litigates is the Center for Civil Rights.&#8221; The center, as the name suggests, does legal work for civil rights and low-income groups.
