<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This post first appeared on <a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-should-school-leaders-know-about-gamification/">Educating Modern Learners</a></em></p>
<p>Widespread adoption of games in education always seems to be <a href="http://www.freshandnew.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/HorizonReportTalesFuturePast.jpg">&ldquo;on the horizon&rdquo;</a> &ndash; never quite fully accepted or integrated into schooling despite the  long-standing excitement about games&rsquo; educational potential.</p>
<p>There  are a number of reasons for this, least of which being that the idea of  games as &ldquo;play&rdquo; runs afoul of some people&rsquo;s concept of learning as  &ldquo;work.&rdquo; Proponents of games in education counter that this dichotomy  between work and play is false, that games are far from frivolous, that  games demand a certain type of mental effort (&ldquo;work&rdquo;) that fosters  problem solving, and that they can boost student interest and  engagement.</p>
<p>But this emphasis on interest and engagement as a goal  in and of itself has led in part to the push for &ldquo;gamification&rdquo; in  education, something that is quite different than &ldquo;game-based learning.&rdquo;  Indeed, gamification might be something that looks a lot more like the  traditional mechanisms and goals of education (something that, arguably,  could explain why it's seen a lot more adoption than has "game-based  learning.")</p>
<h2>"Gamification" Is Not "Game-Based Learning"</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game">game</a> is generally seen as &ldquo;structured play,&rdquo; with rules and objectives.  While a game can (and probably should) be fun, it can also have  educational components to it, particularly in the case of games of skill  (versus, say, games of luck).</p>
<p>The term "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">gamification</a>"  has gained popularity in recent years alongside the rise of social  applications that incorporate some rewards-based systems (Foursquare  check-ins, for example). Gamification means making non-gaming  applications or events more game-like by adding points, badges, titles,  and other game mechanics. "Leveling up" can be used to demonstrate  progress or mastery, for example. Khan Academy is just one ed-tech  product that uses gamification to reward students for completing  exercises by giving them badges and special avatars.</p>
<p>The point of gamification: to make things more &ldquo;fun&rdquo; and &ldquo;engaging&rdquo; and to incentivize certain behaviors.</p>
<p>That latter element is important, particularly in education, as gamification can be seen to tie neatly into a long history of <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/behavioralpsychology/f/behaviorism.htm">behaviorism</a> (think BF Skinner and &ldquo;operant conditioning&rdquo;): curbing &ldquo;bad behaviors&rdquo;  and rewarding &ldquo;good behaviors&rdquo; as key principles of schooling.</p>
<p>Many game-maker <a href="http://bogost.com/blog/gamification_is_bullshit/">object</a> to the idea of &ldquo;gamification,&rdquo; saying that it distorts games &ndash;  emphasizing things like points and trophies without recognizing what&rsquo;s  valuable (or pleasurable or challenging even) about games. Gamification  encourages "fake achievement," <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662656/sixty-two-reasons-why-gamification-is-played-out">as one researcher puts it</a>.</p>
<p>Jeff Watson, who writes critically about gamification &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/question/how-does-gamification-affect-learning/response/gamification-dont-say-it-dont-do-it-just-sto">Don&rsquo;t say it, don&rsquo;t do it, just stop</a>&rdquo; &ndash; offers this distinction between games and gamification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A  true game is a set of rules and procedures that generates problems and  situations that demand inventive solutions. A game is about play and  disruption and creativity and ambiguity and surprise. A game is about  the unexpected. Gamification, on the other hand, is about the expected,  the known, the badgeable, and the quantifiable. It is about &ldquo;checking  in&rdquo; and being tracked. It&rsquo;s not about breaking free, but rather about  becoming more regimented. It&rsquo;s a surveillance and discipline system &mdash; a  wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing. Beware its lure.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Can Gamification Support Independent Learning?</h2>
<p>When  it comes to gamification and education, no doubt it&rsquo;s worth asking  what&rsquo;s being &ldquo;gamified&rdquo; and how and why. (It&rsquo;s probably worth asking too  what we mean by terms like &ldquo;engagement.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Can we reconcile  gamification and independent learning? Can gamification encourage  autonomy and creativity? Or does gamification necessarily re-inscribe  someone else&rsquo;s goals?</p>
<p>Watson argues that gamification is &ldquo;not  concerned with teaching learners how to learn, but rather shockingly  exclusively with offering them a set of discrete objects that they must  accumulate (in part or in whole) in order to be credentialed.&rdquo; As such,  is "gamification" simply a way to substitute interest in the creative  and transformative potential for game-based learning for something much  more akin to marketing or compliance?</p>
<h2>Questions for Schools:</h2>
<p>How  can we design games for learning without falling into the trap,  outlined here, of an overly simplified or meaningless gamification of  the classroom? What do &ldquo;good games&rdquo; for learning look like? How can we  get students involved in designing them?</p>
<p>Can game mechanics be  used in ways that are liberatory? How do we avoid a focus on extrinsic  motivations and encourage students to discover intrinsic motivations for  learning?</p>
