<p>It's that time of year again for my back-to-school technology survey, and I'd love to hear your thoughts.  (My coverage of teachers' favorites from <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/teachers_pick_their_top_5_back-to-school_tech_tool.php">2010</a>, <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2011/08/the-most-anticipated-tech-tools-of-back-to-school-2011/">2011</a>, and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/09/04/back-to-school-technology-2012/">2012</a>.)</p>
