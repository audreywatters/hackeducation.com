<p>What makes an <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/08/07/what-makes-a-revolutionary-ed-tech-startup/">ed-tech startup "revolutionary"</a>?  I asked the question in early August here on Hack Education.  And last weekend I offered my thoughts over at ReadWriteWeb with five of the things I look for when assessing <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/08/5-ways-tech-startups-can-disru.php">ed-tech startup's potential for disruption</a>.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The product or service should be free(mium)</li>
<li>The tool should encourage grassroots adoption</li>
<li>The tool needs to promote 21st century teaching and learning</li>
<li>The tool should contain and encourage open content</li>
<li>The technology needs to be open source</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm thrilled that the post was well-received and widely read (having once been told that education stories get "lousy pageviews").  And I'm weighing how best to follow up (in terms of words and action).</p>
<h2>Who Are These Disruptive Startups?</h2>
<p>I didn't published a list of the startups I think are "disruptive," instead just linking to a <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-startups-in-the-education-space">Quora discussion</a> along the same lines and the <a href="http://www.mastersinteaching.net/top-25-web-startups-revolutionizing-teaching.html">Teaching Master</a> post that originally inspired me.  (Not surprisingly, that Quora thread has had quite a few more suggestions lately, with folks pointing out additional ed-tech startups that are "interesting.")</p>
<p>While I do think it's important to highlight startups that are really innovative (I try), I am cautious about being both the <a href="http://www.iste.org/Content/NavigationMenu/NETS/NETSSealofAlignment/NETS_Seal_of_Alignment.htm">creator of the set of requirements and the arbiter of who makes the grade</a>.  (It doesn't stop me from making a mental list; it just stops me from publishing it.)</p>
<h2>What's Missing From My List?</h2>
<p>Even though he pointed out that my list was insufficient, I was excited to have George Siemens respond to my article.  In a <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2010/08/31/5-ways-tech-startups-can-disrupt-education/">post</a> on his website, he's added another twelve things that startups need to tackle in order to really effect a disruptive change:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Be based on a unit of influence that is at the control of each individual (i.e. connections not networks)</li>
<li>Scale social interactions (not only content) so large network learning occurs, but in a way that permits various group/collective sizes</li>
<li>Promote and benefit from learner autonomy, helping learners to building skills and capacity for ongoing learning</li>
<li>Use distributed, decentralized technical infrastructure (p2p not centralized)</li>
<li>Extensively use learning analytics, preferably blurring physical and virtual interactions</li>
<li>Use curriculum intelligently (linked data/semantic web) in order to provide learners with personal and adaptive paths</li>
<li>Allow information splicing so that flows can be adjusted and organized to reflect different learning and social tasks</li>
<li>Enable easy variance of contexts - or as my colleague Jon Dron states - context switching</li>
<li>Offer varying levels of support and structure, under the control of the learner. If a subject is too challenging, learners can choose a structured learning path. Or, if learners prefer greater autonomy, more flexible paths can be adopted.</li>
<li>The system needs to learn from the learners (Hunch is a good example)</li>
<li>Integrate activities from various services so learners can centrally interact with data left in other services (Greplin)</li>
<li>Provide learners with the tools to connect and form learning networks with others in a course and across various disciplines (diversity exposure to ideas and connections needs to be intentional)</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought it was particularly interesting that two of the examples he gives, <a href="http://www.hunch.com">Hunch</a> and <a href="http://www.greplin.com">Greplin</a> are not expressly "ed-tech," another sign, I'd contend that the disruptive players in ed-tech will not be the names we now associate with the industry.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>I tweeted that I'm always keen to hear about new "disruptive" ed-tech startups, and <a href="http://www.funnymonkey.com">Bill Fitzgerald</a> rightly pointed out that those who describe themselves that way are often more spin than substance -- sad but true.</p>
<p>There's another thread on Quora now, asking why there's a lack of innovation in <a href="http://www.quora.com/Technology-in-Education/Why-is-there-a-lack-of-innovation-in-educational-technology-for-school-aged-children-compared-to-high-school-higher-ed">K-12 ed-tech</a>.  I'm not sure I agree that that's the case.  But clearly, there's both perception and, well, reality that we're not doing enough to even demonstrate the semblance of disruption in education technology.</p>
