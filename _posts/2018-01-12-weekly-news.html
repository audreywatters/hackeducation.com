<p><em>Each week, I gather a wide variety of links to education and education technology articles. All this feeds the review I write each December on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the stories we are told</a> about the future of education.</em></p>

<h3>(National) Education Politics <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2018_icon_politics2.jpg" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>I&#8217;ll lead off this week&#8217;s roundup of education news with this from England, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/09/toby-young-resigns-office-for-students">from The Guardian</a>: &#8220;<strong>Toby Young</strong> resigns from the <strong>Office for Students</strong> after backlash.&#8221; More <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/09/toby-young-how-barrage-of-nudges-made-ofs-position-untenable">from The Guardian</a>. And more Toby Young (and eugenics) news in the &#8220;meanwhile on campus&#8221; section below.</p>

<p>Still more education news from the UK: &#8220;<strong>Sam Gyimah</strong> replaces <strong>Jo Johnson</strong> as <strong>universities minister</strong>,&#8221; <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/sam-gyimah-replaces-jo-johnson-universities-minister">The Times Higher Education reports</a>. &#8220;<strong>Damian Hinds</strong> is new <strong>education secretary</strong>, replacing <strong>Justine Greening</strong>,&#8221; <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/education-42604157">says the BBC</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the US can&#8217;t let the UK lead for too long when it comes to terrible people and terrible ideas in education. So <a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/01/08/make-public-education-a-market-economy--not-a.html">here&#8217;s an early contender for &#8220;Worst Education &#8216;Take&#8217; of 2018&#8217;&#8221; by Gary Wolfram in Education Week</a>: &#8220;<strong>Make Public Education a Market Economy &#8211; Not a Socialist One</strong>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty terrible to report on how a &#8220;<strong>President Oprah</strong>&#8221; would shape education policy and not talk about how she has actively promoted pseudoscience. But maybe a lot of education policy is based on pseudoscience, so that&#8217;s why we can just let that slide&#8230; <a href="https://chalkbeat.org/posts/us/2018/01/09/president-winfrey-heres-what-we-know-about-oprahs-education-outlook/">Via Chalkbeat</a>: &#8220;President Winfrey?
