<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>This week's show includes discussion about:</p>
<p><strong>0:31</strong>: &nbsp;More thoughts about what we mean when we talk about "<a href="/2012/04/22/scaling-college-composition/">scaling</a>" in education. &nbsp;How do we leverage the human network, not just the technology?</p>
<p><strong>4:32</strong>: &nbsp;We talk about the research tool <a href="http://instagrok.com">Instagrok</a>&nbsp;(Steve's favorite <a href="/2012/04/23/instagrok-research-search-engine-for-education/">story</a> of the week, incidentally).</p>
<p><strong>9:10</strong>: &nbsp;Steve didn't love as much the <a href="/2012/04/24/google-apps-for-education-and-the-new-google-drive/">shift to Google Drive</a>. &nbsp;How will this work for Apps for Education users? &nbsp;And can Google start to compete with some of the legacy players in the LMS space? &nbsp;What about privacy issues? &nbsp;Do we really want everything we do under Google's scrutiny?</p>
<p><strong>42:11</strong>: TED-Ed versus the new Khan Academy and MIT student joint project. &nbsp;Two different news items about two different approaches to video lessons.</p>
