<p>I am making some changes to how this site earns money &#8211; or rather, Hack Education will not solicit any donations from readers for the foreseeable future. I am closing my Patreon account, and while I cannot cancel any recurring payments that are coming via PayPal &#8211; <em>you</em> have to do that &#8211; starting today, I will refund these as they come in.</p>

<p>I cannot in good conscience continue to take people&#8217;s cash as there is really nothing happening on this site. I am not quitting Hack Education or &#8220;ed-tech,&#8221; although god knows I&#8217;ve thought about it. </p>

<p>I still need to earn a living, of course. For now, I plan to do that through speaking and writing. I just don&#8217;t know how much of those words will appear here on this website.</p>
