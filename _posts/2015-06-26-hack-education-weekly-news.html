<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has chosen Donna Bahorich to chair the state&#8217;s board of education. Bahorich has <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2015/06/texas-gov-greg-abbott-picks-homeschooler-to-chair-state-board-of-education/">never sent her children to public school</a>, opting to homeschool her sons.</p>

<p>Governor Abbott has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/us/texas-law-decriminalizes-school-truancy.html">signed a bill</a> that decriminalizes truancy in Texas.</p>

<p><a href="http://edsource.org/2015/schools-consider-impact-of-ending-vaccination-opt-outs/82010">Senate Bill 277</a> has passed in California, which will end the personal belief exemption for vaccination school children.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure there are many prominent Republicans left who have yet to announce their presidential candidacy. (Oh wait. Christie. Palin.) This week: Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal. (&#8220;<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/06/bobby-jindal-zack-kopplin-evolution">Bobby Jindal's Biggest Troll Is His Friend's 21-Year-Old Son</a>.&#8221;)</p>

<p>The Department of Education has decided not to move forward with its plans to create a college ratings system. <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/231169/">Instead</a> it&#8217;s going to make a &#8220;consumer-focused website.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Department of Education has <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2015/06/federal-student-aid-pin-1998-2015/">axed</a> the PIN number for FAFSA applications.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve totally lost track of where we are on the NCLB waiver front, but the Obama Administration <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2015/06/23/education-dept-extends-more-no-child-left-behind-waivers">extended</a> them to 7 more states and DC this week.</p>

<p>The White House is <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/25/fact-sheet-connected-two-years-delivering-opportunity-k-12-schools">boasting</a> about its ConnectEd initiative, which it says is &#8220;on track to achieve its goal of connecting students to tools they need for 21st century learning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chicago Public Schools has released a <a href="http://chicagoinno.streetwise.co/2015/06/25/cps-edtech-catalog-announced-amid-districts-financial-troubles/">catalog</a> featuring 74 approved ed-tech vendors. (I haven&#8217;t gone through the list to see how many investor and CPS board member Deborah Quazzo has invested in, but I&#8217;m hoping Chicago Sun Times reporter Lauren Fitzpatrick, <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news-chicago/7/71/223620/cps-profitable-investment-board-ed-member">who broke the story last year about Quazzo&#8217;s portfolio and CPS contracts</a>, will.)</p>

<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wants search engines to crack down on <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/government-asks-search-engines-to-cut-student-loan-scams#.cqd70DWq7">student loan scams</a>.</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p>A federal judge has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/06/24/judge-rejects-second-gainful-challenge">dismissed</a> a lawsuit filed by a for-profit college trade group, challenging the Department of Education&#8217;s &#8220;gainful employment&#8221; rule. <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/big-victory-for-regulating-for-profit-colleges#.vvGoQ1e9o">More via Buzzfeed</a>.</p>

<p>Paperwork was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/24/us-usa-california-teachers-idUSKBN0P42N420150624">filed</a> this week in the appeal of last year&#8217;s Vergara ruling in California, which overturned the state&#8217;s tenure laws.</p>

<p><a href="http://laschoolreport.com/most-famous-teacher-plans-class-action-suit-over-lausds-teacher-jail/#more-35283">Via LA School Report</a>: &#8220;High-profile attorney Mark Geragos, representing one of the most famous active teachers in the country, Rafe Esquith, told the Los Angeles Times he intends to file a class action lawsuit on behalf of &#8216;scores&#8217; of district teachers who say they have been denied due process rights. Geragos said he had filed a legal claim on Monday, which is a precursor to a lawsuit.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Testing, Testing&#8230;</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/us/grading-the-common-core-no-teaching-experience-required.html">A story by Motoko Rich in The New York Times</a> notes that those who grade Common Core exams need not be or have been teachers. (USC professor Morgan Polikoff responds on the &#8220;<a href="http://morganpolikoff.com/2015/06/23/testing-tradeoffs/">Testing tradeoffs</a>.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Oregon Governor Kate Brown has <a href="http://registerguard.com/rg/news/local/33225736-75/oregon-governor-signs-smarter-balanced-opt-out-law.html.csp">signed legislation</a> that makes it easier for parents in her state to opt their children out of standardized testing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/world/europe/coping-students-in-france-just-arent.html">Via The New York Times</a>: &#8220;There is no easy translation or even a firm concept of the word &#8216;coping&#8217; in French, so when it turned up last week in a question on the national exam to earn a high school degree, it set off a fracas among the 350,000 or so students who took the test.&#8221;</p>

<h3>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h3>
<br />
<p>MOOCs were back in the news &#8211; or at least in the op-ed pages &#8211; this week. I wrote <a href="http://hackeducation.com/archives.html">two MOOC-related stories</a>. (I apologize.) See also: &#8220;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/06/the-secret-power-of-moocs/396608/">The (Accidental) Power of MOOCs</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Writing instructors at Arizona State University, who have since December been protesting a plan to change their compensation in ways they said were unfair and would hurt teaching and learning, have won both a gain in pay and a new option on course load,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/06/22/arizona-state-will-provide-more-money-and-more-options-non-tenure-track-writing">Inside Higher Ed reports</a>.

Effectively, this means that Google had taken itself the right to listen to every conversation in every room that runs Chrome somewhere, without any kind of consent from the people eavesdropped on.&#8221;</p>

<p>I can't remember the last time I read one of D2L's announcements without rolling my eyes. I used to have respect for the company, but now I have to make a conscious effort not to dismiss any of their pronouncements out-of-hand. Not because I think it's impossible that they might be doing good work, but because they force me to dive into a mountain of horseshit in the hopes of finding a nugget of gold at the bottom. Every. Single. Time. </p>
