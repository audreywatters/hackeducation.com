<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>This week, we spent a lot of time talking about the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/03/26/blackboard-moodlerooms-open-washing/">surprising news from Blackboard</a>, with its acquisition of Moodlerooms and its unveiling of an open source initiative.  What are the implications on open source technologies, open source communities, learners' data?  Well, listen in to hear our thoughts.  We also talk about the Atlanta-Journal-Constitution's story about "irregularities" in testing data nationwide.</p>
