<p>A look at <a href="http://goodsemester.com">GoodSemester</a> which founder Jason Rappaport demoed for me on Monday, insisting it is <strong>not</strong> an LMS. But with Monday's <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/03/26/blackboard-moodlerooms-open-washing/">big LMS hubbub</a>, I decided to wait a day to post this story nonetheless.</p>
<p>You can read about GoodSemester, which is a little bit Evernote, a little bit Google Docs, a little bit Dropbox, a lot like BaseCamp -- with bonus support for OER materials -- over on <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/goodsemester-basecamp-oer">Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
