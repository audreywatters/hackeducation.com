<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this week's recording was plagued with some technical difficulties. &nbsp;(I blame Skype. And probably user error. &nbsp;But mostly Skype.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the recording does capture a very interesting discussion about content (and data) ownership and content delivery systems -- something that Steve and I are likely to discuss in our upcoming plenary session at the <a href="http://sloanconsortium.org/conference/2012/et4online/plenary">Sloan-C's symposium</a>.</p>
<p>The link to the MP3 of the show is below, and/or you can subscribe to  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/edtechlive/hackeducation">the podcast feed</a>. You can also find the podcast in iTunes, as part of Steve's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/edtechlive/id219875737">EdTechLive series</a>.</p>
