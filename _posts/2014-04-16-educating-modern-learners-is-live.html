<p>Just a quick note to announce that <strong><a href="http://modernlearners.com">Educating Modern Learners</a> </strong>is now live!</p>
<p><a href="http://audreywatters.com/2014/01/21/educating-modern-learners-announcement/">As I wrote earlier this year</a>, I&rsquo;ve undertaken a new writing and editing project: a site dedicated to news and analysis about the future of teaching and learning through a progressive education (and progressive ed-tech) lens. Today we hit &ldquo;publish&rdquo; on our first newsletter.</p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s issue looks broadly at how technologies might prompt us to reframe our demands for &ldquo;literacy&rdquo; and includes writing from <strong>Lee Skallerup Bessette </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Doug Belshaw</strong>. Next week&rsquo;s issue includes writing from <strong>Cedar Riener</strong> and an interview with <strong>Roger Schank</strong> and asks, among other things, about the role of science and data in how we rethink schooling.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks and months, Educating Modern Learners will feature stories by <strong>Bonnie Stewart</strong>, <strong>Chad Sansing</strong>, <strong>Tressie McMillan Cottom</strong>, <strong>Liz Dwyer</strong>, <strong>Andr&eacute;s Monroy-Hern&aacute;ndez</strong>, <strong>Jabiz Raisdana</strong>, <strong>Vanessa Genarelli</strong>, and <strong>Verena Roberts</strong>, as well as by EML founders <strong>Will Richardson</strong> and <strong>Bruce Dixon</strong> and by yours truly. We&rsquo;ll be talking about maker spaces, online assessment, online community, open learning, self-directed learning and race, class, and gender, narratives about college readiness and about &ldquo;skills&rdquo; and &ldquo;skills gaps&rdquo; and much much more. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s another site that offers such smart analysis from such smart folks. <em>I think that makes it <a href="http://modernlearners.com/eml-subscription-options/">worth subscribing</a></em>.</p>
