<h2>Ferguson</h2>
<p>Protests continued in <strong>Ferguson, Missouri</strong> following the shooting death of teenager <strong>Michael Brown</strong>.</p>
<p>The first day of school was delayed for many, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean teachers had the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/08/19/341651494/ferguson-teachers-use-day-off-as-opportunity-for-a-civics-lesson">day off</a>.&rdquo; (Good grief headline writers.) The <strong>Ferguson Public Library</strong> has become a &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench/status/502536671079170048/photo/1">makeshift community school</a>,&rdquo; offering lessons, tutoring, meals, and childcare.</p>
<p>There are a number of <a href="http://breed7910.wordpress.com/2014/08/16/campaigns-for-mikebrown-ferguson/"><strong>fundraising initiatives</strong></a> to help <strong>support the community</strong>, including efforts to <a href="http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/08/18/kids-ferguson-arent-alright-so-inspiring-teacher-set-campaign-feed-them?cmpid=organic-share-twitter">provide food</a> for school-age children. Heck, even <a href="http://www.maryengelbreit.com/store/In-The-USA-Fine-Print.html">Mary Engelbreit</a> (yes. that Mary Engelbreit) is helping raise money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This school year at Normandy was already going to be a challenge. The district lost its state accreditation in 2012 in the wake of steadily falling revenues, plummeting graduation rates&mdash;among the lowest in the state&mdash;and excessive disciplinary actions. Students in the district, where over ninety percent of children are eligible for free meals, were allowed to leave Normandy to attend other nearby schools; hundreds did. Now, they&rsquo;ve been required to return after the state department of education this year took control of the school administration and forced all teachers to reapply for their jobs. Forty percent of teachers were not asked to return.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/federal-investigators-crack-down-on-two-virginia-schools-use-of-restraints">According to ProPublica</a>, which has been investigating <strong>schools&rsquo; usage of restraints</strong>, "Federal investigators have faulted two <strong>Virginia</strong> schools for pinning down and isolating disabled students improperly, saying the schools used the practices routinely as a &lsquo;one-size fits all&rsquo; response to disruptive behavior despite evidence they didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

WTF. Who owns that data?</p>
<p><strong>Confidential student data</strong> was accessible to unauthorized people in the <strong>Topeka Unified School District 501</strong> via Pearson <strong>PowerSchool</strong>. The data in question revealed which children in the district came from low income families, data that is federally restricted. The district assured the Department of Agriculture that the data breach had been fixed, but apparently <a href="http://cjonline.com/news/2014-08-20/data-leak-not-fixed-topeka-school-leaders-thought">it has not</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>LAUSD</strong> spent $112 million a decade ago on a new school information system. Then the district scrapped that SIS a couple of years ago to make way for a new one, spending another $20 million in the process. And now, it's back-to-school, and we learn <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-utla-campaign-20140821-story.html">the new system doesn&rsquo;t really work</a>.</p>
<p>But hey, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-discipline-20140820-story.html"><strong>LAUSD police</strong></a> will no longer cite students for minor offenses like not wearing school uniforms. &ldquo;Graduation not incarceration,&rdquo; says Superintendent John Deasy.</p>
