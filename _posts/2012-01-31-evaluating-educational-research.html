<p>"4 out of 5 dentists surveyed would recommend sugarless gum to their patients who chew gum."  That's a slogan long associated with Trident gum.  But most people are probably skeptical of that claim, and we wouldn't really view a chewing gum commercial as a scientific claim.  Who conducted the research?  Where was it published? What were the survey questions? And what about that famous fifth dentist?</p>
<p>But when it comes to education research, we don't always scrutinize things so closely -- particularly when it comes to results that confirm our gut reactions or further particular commercial or political agendas.</p>
<p>Case in point:  does the iPad boost student learning?  Is it a solid educational tool?  That's the <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/01/ipad-educational-aid-study/">headline from a recent article in Wired magazine</a> that argues that the devices are improving student engagement and assessment.</p>
<p><span>The article draws on two recent studies conducted on iPad apps: one on Houghton Mifflin Harcourt&rsquo;s Fuse Algebra I app (see MindShift&rsquo;s coverage&nbsp;</span><a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2012/01/study-shows-algebra-ipad-app-improves-scores-in-one-school/">here</a><span>) and one on Motion Math&rsquo;s fraction app (see MindShift&rsquo;s coverage&nbsp;</span><a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/12/proof-in-study-math-app-improves-test-scores-and-engagement/">here</a><span>). Both of these studies tout positive results for the apps in question: In the case of the former, state standardized test scores jumped by 20%; in the case of the latter, students&rsquo; scores improved an average of 15%.</span></p>
