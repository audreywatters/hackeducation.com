<p><a href="http://www.blackboard.com">Blackboard</a> now has an Android app that includes information about Athletics, Courses, Directory, Library, Maps, and News.  Blackboard makes me grumpy, but you can see via this <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2010/09/29/blackboard-mobile-is-another-example-of-how-mobile-and-location-are-changing-everything/">video interview by Robert Scoble</a> that Blackboard has a good mobile strategy, thanks to its acquisition of Terribly Clever.</p>
<p><a href="http://kno.com">Kno</a> did promise its tablet would be "<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/09/08/big-money-for-the-educational-tablet-kno-but-will-you-buy-it/">under $1000</a>," and the company has announced the pricing for its new educational tablet:  $599 for the single screen and $899 for the dual screen tablets.  By comparison, the 64GB iPad costs $699 and the new 11" MacBook Air, at $999, can also boast the "under $1000" price tag.</p>

<p>A report based on recent U.S. Census data shows that the "Digital Divide" persists.  Even though 64% of U.S. households have high-speed internet, broadband adoptions still lags in poor, rural, and minority households.  See my <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/broadband_subscriptions_are_up_but_digital_divide.php">ReadWriteWeb story</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Washington State has launched an <a href="http://opencourselibrary.wikispaces.com/">Open Course Library</a> in an effort to save money by relying on open source textbooks for the state's 81 most popular college courses.  There's a good <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2013373872_textbooks08m.html">Seattle Times</a> story on the project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.librarything.com/blogs/thingology/2010/11/library-anywhere-android-app-now-available/">LibraryThing</a> now has an Android app.  Now I just need to remember my LibraryThing email and password so I can walk up and down my bookshelves and catalog with ease.</p>
<p>And to wrap things up here with a little moral panic, the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/09/texting-teens-sex-and-dru_n_780863.html">AP reports</a> that teens that text more have more sex and do more drugs.</p>
