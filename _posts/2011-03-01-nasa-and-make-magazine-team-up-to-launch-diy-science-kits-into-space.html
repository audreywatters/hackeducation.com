<p><a href="http://www.nasa.gov">NASA</a> and <a href="http://www.makezine.com">Make</a> magazine are joining forces to help build and launch DIY science projects into outerspace, which, if I may say so, elevates <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/citizen-science/">citizen science</a> to a whole new level of awesome.  The two have just announced a new initiative, the <a href="http://www.makezine.com/space/">NASA Make Challenge:  Experimental Science Kits for Space</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2011/03/2011-nasa-make-challenge.html">blog post</a> on Make, Dale Dougherty recounts a conversation with NASA's Lynn Harper who said that the space agency needs "not hundreds of experiments going into space but hundreds of thousands of experiments."</p>
<p>NASA apparently has recognized that by tapping into the maker and educational communities, it can do precisely that.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the <a href="http://www.teachersinspace.org/">Teachers in Space</a> program, the NASA Make Challenge will develop inexpensive science kits that can be built in a classroom and then sent on suborbital flights in order to conduct experiments.</p>
<p>The kits should use components that are readily available at most high schools, and the experiments need to be self-contained and fit in a standard Cubesat container (an international standard for small space payloads). You also need to be able to build these kits for under $100, as <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/releases/2011/11-14AR.html">NASA says</a>, "the kind of funds that could be raised by a school bake sale."</p>
<p>You can sign up for a mailing list via Make's <a href="http://makezine.com/space/">website</a>.  The winner will be announced at the <a href="http://makerfaire.com/bayarea/2011/">Bay Area Maker Faire</a> this spring.  And the first mission with the DIY science kits should launch some time this year.</p>
