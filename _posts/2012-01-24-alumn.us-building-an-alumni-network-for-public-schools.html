<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/alumnus150.jpg" alt="" align="left" />Over on <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2012/01/watch-out-facebook-a-new-social-network-targets-alumni/">MindShift</a> today, I have a look at <a href="http://alumn.us">Alumn.us</a>, a startup that describes itself as "an online engagement platform for under-served schools, we empower kids to make changes to their schools, and give alumni, parents, and other community members the tools to support them."  This isn't Classmates v2.0.  It's an attempt to take on the great disparities between alumni support for the public and community college systems and those in play at private schools and universities.</p>
