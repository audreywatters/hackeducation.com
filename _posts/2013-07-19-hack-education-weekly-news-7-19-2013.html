<h2>MOOOOOOOOOOOOOCs</h2>
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/original.gif" alt="" align="right" />Remember in January when <strong>Udacity</strong> and <strong>San Jose State University</strong> <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/01/15/udacity-moocs-for-credit-in-california/">announced a pilot program</a> where the latter would offer college credit for classes offered by the former? Remember how <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/15/how-californias-new-online-education-pilot-will-end-college-as-we-know-it/">Techcrunch said</a> it would &ldquo;end college as we know it?&rdquo; Well, there&rsquo;s MOOC-egg on some faces this week as SJSU plans to &ldquo;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/07/18/citing-disappointing-student-outcomes-san-jose-state-pauses-work-udacity">pause</a>&rdquo; the effort, citing the poor performance of enrolled students. &ldquo;74 percent or more of the students in traditional classes passed, while no more than 51 percent of Udacity students passed any of the three courses,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/07/18/citing-disappointing-student-outcomes-san-jose-state-pauses-work-udacity">according to Inside Higher Ed</a>. It&rsquo;s worth noting that SJSU students taking <strong>edX</strong> classes, which are offered in a &ldquo;blended&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;online-only&rdquo; setting, seem to be doing better than those in traditional classes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/07/17/moocs-spread-quickly-aided-no-bid-deals-public-universities">Inside Higher Ed&rsquo;s Ry Rivard</a> examines the deals signed between public universities and MOOC providers: &ldquo;At least 21 universities and higher education systems in 16 states have signed agreements with <strong>Coursera</strong>, <strong>Udacity</strong> or <strong>edX</strong> without going through a competitive bidding process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But hey, <strong>Georgia Tech</strong> and <strong>Udacity</strong> have announced <a href="http://www.blog.class-central.com/georgia-tech-oms-cs-coures/">the classes to be offered</a> as part of their joint Online Masters in Computer Science.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not too late to sign up for <a href="http://www.learningbygivingfoundation.org/">the philanthropy MOOC run by <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>&rsquo;s sister</a>, which culminates in helping Buffett decide how to give away $100,000. I guess they&rsquo;re not using robot-assessments for this MOOC. Yay?</p>
<p>Another indication, perhaps, that <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/edtechresearcher/2013/05/the_mooc_as_three_kinds_of_learning_management_system.html"><strong>Coursera</strong> is becoming an LMS</a>: the <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/cc/">IMS Global Learning Consortium</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/LearningImpact/status/356804700869378048">announced</a> the MOOC startup is the newest member of the Common Cartridge and LTI alliance (this alliance supports standards used by the LMS industry for data interoperability).</p>
<p>Speaking at the Microsoft Research Faculty Summit, <strong>Bill Gates</strong> said that MOOC providers should learn some lessons from the <strong>for-profit college</strong> sector in order to better support students&rsquo; success. &ldquo;Because they are profit driven, the way they track students and see what&rsquo;s going on&rdquo; could be seen by MOOCs and public universities as a &ldquo;best practice,&rdquo; Gates argued, <a href="http://www.ecampusnews.com/business-news/bill-gates-mooc-providers-should-take-a-lesson-from-for-profit-college-sector/">according to ECampusNews</a>. LOLWUT.</p>
<h2>DC Politics</h2>
<p>The US House of Representatives <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/20/education/house-votes-to-shift-no-child-left-behind-oversight-to-states.htm">has passed a revision</a> to <strong>No Child Left Behind</strong>, the most recent and most infamous reauthorization of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act signed into law by President George W. Bush. This week's newly-passed bill rolls back many of the accountability requirements of NCLB and transfers much oversight of the country&rsquo;s public school system to the states. However, President Obama says he&rsquo;ll veto it if it gets to his desk, so yeah... no ESEA reauthorization once again. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/20/education/house-votes-to-shift-no-child-left-behind-oversight-to-states.html">More details in The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>Senators have reached a deal to address <strong>student loan interest rates</strong>, which doubled on July 1. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/us/politics/senate-reaches-deal-to-end-fight-over-student-loan-interest-rates.html">According to The New York Times</a>, &ldquo;Undergraduates would pay the 10-year Treasury note rate, 2.49 percent on Wednesday, plus 2.05 percent, with a cap of 8.25 percent, to protect them from inflation. Graduate students would pay the 10-year Treasury rate plus 3.6 percent, with a cap of 9.5 percent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In related student indebtedness news, <strong>the outstanding debt on federal student loans on surpassed $1 trillion</strong> <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/140427/">for this time this week</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2013/07/13/feds-may-raise-phone-taxes-fund-common-core-test-taking">Heartland reports</a> that the Obama Administration might raise<strong> phone taxes</strong> (by $5/year), as the FCC looks to revise the E-rate program, in order to increase subsidies for K&ndash;12 broadband &ldquo;because most schools cannot administer the computerized Common Core tests coming out in 2015.&rdquo; Sounds like a winning rationale.</p>
<h2>State Politics</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/07/16/5005263/ap-exclusive-daniels-looked-to.html">According to emails obtained by the Associated Press</a>, <strong>Mitch Daniels</strong>, former governor of <strong>Indiana</strong> and now president of <strong>Purdue University</strong>, sought to purge Howard Zinn&rsquo;s writings from the state&rsquo;s classrooms. &ldquo;This terrible anti-American academic has finally passed away,&rsquo; Daniels wrote in an email. &rdquo;Can someone assure me that is not in use anywhere in Indiana? If it is, how do we get rid of it before more young people are force-fed a totally false version of our history?" Emails also show Daniels trying to cut funding to a program run by Charles Little, executive director of the Indiana Urban Schools Assocation, professor at the Indiana University School of Education, and a sharp critic of the then-governor.</p>
<p><strong>Utah</strong> State Senator Aaron Osmond, nephew of Donnie and Marie, is <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865583185/Utah-lawmaker-calls-for-end-of-compulsory-education.html">calling for the end of &ldquo;compulsory education&rdquo;</a> in the state.</p>
<h2>Cooper Union Politics</h2>
<p>The student occupation of <strong>Cooper Union</strong> has ended. The students have been occupying the university&rsquo;s president&rsquo;s office in protest of its plans to institute tuition fees for the first time in the institution's history. Students have reached a negotiated agreement with the school, and among the concessions that the students won, "A working group of students, faculty, alumni, administrators, and trustees is to be established to &rsquo;to explore ways in which Cooper Union may revert to providing full-tuition scholarships for all enrolled students.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href="http://studentactivism.net/2013/07/15/cooper-occupation-ends/">More details via Angus Johnston</a>.</p>
<h2>Universities and The Law</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, Wired journalist Kevin Poulsen had his FOIA request for Secret Service files pertaining to the late Internet activist <strong>Aaron Swartz</strong> denied, and after he filed a lawsuit to appeal, a judge ruled that the government had to begin releasing the files. But now, <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/mit-swartz-intervene/">reports Poulsen</a>, lawyers representing <strong>MIT</strong> have filed a motion to block the release of relevant documents.</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324263404578612244100607524.html">The Wall Street Journal reports</a> that the <strong>Penn State</strong> board of trustees has authorized $60 million to settle 25 personal injury claims by those who say they were sexually abused by former football coach Jerry Sandusky.</p>
<h2>Launches and Upgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Jim Groom</strong> and <strong>Tim Owens</strong> have launched &ldquo;<a href="http://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a>,&rdquo; as part of a larger <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/04/11/reclaim-your-domain/">Reclaim Your Domain</a> effort. Related to <strong>University of Mary Washington</strong>&rsquo;s <a href="http://umwdomains.com/">Domain of One&rsquo;s Own</a> initiative, Reclaim Hosting aims to help educators and students with their own hosting &ndash; &ldquo;just one piece to the larger puzzle of how we allow people to easily feed their digital content back into a space they own and control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coming soon from the video game maker <strong>Valve</strong>: <a href="http://pipeline.valvesoftware.com/index.php">Pipeline</a>, a site run by teenagers for teenagers who are interested in joining the video game industry. &ldquo;Pipeline is an experiment to see if we can take a group of high school students with minimal work experience and train them in the skills and methods necessary to be successful at a company like Valve,&rdquo; reads the nascent website.</p>
<p>Ed-tech blog and listicle champ <strong>Edudemic</strong> is launching a video lesson site, which according to its partner <a href="http://www.educationdive.com/news/edudemic-founders-launch-new-online-learning-platform-modern-lessons/151304/">Education Dive</a>, will be a &ldquo;Khan Academy for real-world skills."</p>
<h2>Downgrades and Discounts</h2>
<p>OK, I realize it&rsquo;s a little catty to put this news item in the &ldquo;downgrade&rdquo; section. But whatever. See, the <strong>One Laptop Per Child XO Tablet</strong> is now on sale <a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/24511209">at <strong>Walmart</strong></a> for $149. No mention of <a href="http://www.papert.org/articles/SituatingConstructionism.html">constructionism</a>, although the description does indicate that it offers &ldquo;parental dashboards [that] track usage and learning styles, allowing parents to better understand their child&rsquo;s development.&rdquo; Ugh, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/September-October%202010/the-myth-of-learning-full.html">learning styles</a>.&rdquo; Kids, this is why we can&rsquo;t have nice things.</p>
<h2>Funding, Earnings, and Acquisitions</h2>
<p>Digital textbook publisher <strong>Inkling</strong> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/17/inking-new-deals-with-pearson-and-elsevier-inkling-nets-16m-from-sequoia-and-more-to-digitize-the-worlds-academic-content/">announced</a> that it&rsquo;s raised $16 million in a Series C round (bringing its total investment to around $48 million). Investors included Sequoia Capital, Felicis Ventures, Tenaya Capital, and JAFCO Technology Partners. The company also says it&rsquo;s struck an agreement with Elsevier and Pearson (the latter is also an <a href="http://readwrite.com/2011/03/22/major_publisher_investment_advances_inkling_as_the">investor in Inkling</a>) with the two publishers using Inkling&rsquo;s <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/02/14/disassembling-the-textbook-inkling-semantic-publishing-platform/">Habitat publishing platform</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> revealed its quarterly earnings this week for its fiscal Q4 of 2013. And on the heels of a <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/07/12/hack-education-weekly-news-7-12-2013/">price cut</a> on its <strong>Surface RT</strong> tablets, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/18/4535976/microsoft-lost-900-million-on-surface-rt">Microsoft has posted</a> a $900 million loss due to &ldquo;inventory adjustments&rdquo; with the tablets. Sorta puts the free giveaway of Surfaces at ISTE in a different light, no?</p>
<p>The <strong>Next Generation Learning Challenges</strong> project has <a href="http://nextgenlearning.org/blog/putting-breakthrough-breakthrough-model-schools">announced</a> eight new recipients of $450,000 &ldquo;breakthrough school model launch&rdquo; grants and 30 recipients of $100,000 planning grants. These grants (and schools) focus on &ldquo;personalized, competency-based, blended learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Grovo</strong>, an online education startup, has <a href="http://www.pehub.com/2013/07/17/online-education-platform-grovo-receives-5-5-mln-series-a-funds/">raised</a> $5.5 million Series A funding. Investors include Greg Waldorf, former CEO of eHarmony. Greg Sands of Costanoa Venture Capital and Jeff Clavier of SoftTech VC.</p>
<p><a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2013/07/15/mimio-headsprout-sold-to-private-equity-firm.aspx">THE Journal reports</a> that two education technology companies, <strong>Mimio</strong> and <strong>Headsprout</strong>, have been sold off by their parent company, Newell Rubbermaid, to the private equity firm Skyview Capital. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p><a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/gittip-at-khan-academy/"><strong>Khan Academy</strong>&rsquo;s John Resig</a> says that the organization will give its developers $5 a week to donate in turn to open source developers using the <strong><a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a></strong> crowdfunding platform.</p>
<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p>Despite <a href="http://www.uaw2865.org/?p=3365">protests</a>, the <strong>UC Board of Regents</strong> has <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/janet-napolitano-university-of-califonia-president-94445.html">approved</a> Homeland Security head <strong>Janet Napolitano</strong> as the UC system&rsquo;s new president. Napolitano will have a <a href="https://twitter.com/laurelrosenhall/status/357975484614721537">salary</a> of $570K, along with a one-time relocation allowance of $142K.</p>
<p>With another scandal looking to sideline him, former <strong>CIA director General David Petraeus</strong> says he&rsquo;ll skip the $200,000 salary for teaching one class as an adjunct at <strong>CUNY</strong>. Instead, he&rsquo;ll just take <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/16/nyregion/petraeuss-cuny-pay-criticized-at-200000-shrinks-to-1.html">a dollar for the gig</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia Commonwealth University</strong> can boast&nbsp;<a href="http://edinsanity.com/2013/07/18/seizing-an-opportunity">two incredible educators</a> in newly-appointed leadership positions: <strong>Gardner Campbell</strong> will become Vice Provost for Learning Innovation and Student Success. And <strong>Jon Becker</strong> will be Director of Online Academic Programs.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p><strong>The Pew Internet and American Life Project</strong> have released more results from its survey of AP and National Writing Project teachers, this one on &ldquo;<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Teachers-technology-and-writing.aspx">The Impact of Digital Tools on Student Writing and How Writing is Taught in Schools</a>.&rdquo; Many of the results aren&rsquo;t terribly surprising: &ldquo;96% agree that digital technologies &lsquo;allow students to share their work with a wider and more varied audience.&rsquo;&rdquo; Um. Duh. &ldquo;91% say that &lsquo;writing effectively&rsquo; is an &lsquo;essential&rsquo; skill students need for future success.&rdquo; Um. Okay. Nonetheless, there&rsquo;s still plenty of handwringing about what digital tools do to the quality of student writing, but this is what made me sigh: 94% make their students do some writing by hand &ldquo;because students are required to write by hand on standardized tests, it is a critical skill for them to have.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/students-prefer-print-but-not-books-for-serious-academic-reading/44871">Yet another survey</a> has found that <strong>students prefer to read academic-oriented material in print</strong>.</p>
<p>A study published in the April-June issue of <em>IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies</em> contends that students do <em>not</em> learn best when watching videos before coming to class to work on hands-on projects. But when the order was reversed &ndash; hands-on experimentation, then reading or watching videos &ndash; students performed better. Now &ldquo;the researchers advocate <strong>the &lsquo;flipped flipped classroom</strong>,&rsquo; in which videos come after exploration and not before,&rdquo; <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/july/flipped-learning-model-071613.html">says the Stanford News</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/world-s-slowest-moving-drop-caught-on-camera-at-last-1.13418">After 69 years</a>, one of the longest running experiments found success this week, as <strong>Trinity College</strong> has managed to capture a &ldquo;pitch drop&rdquo; on video. &ldquo;The Dublin pitch-drop experiment was set up in 1944 at Trinity College Dublin to demonstrate the high viscosity or low fluidity of pitch &mdash; also known as bitumen or asphalt &mdash; a material that appears to be solid at room temperature, but is in fact flowing, albeit extremely slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The Boston School District</strong> has refused to release <strong>teacher performance ratings</strong> to The Boston Globe, <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/07/13/boston-schools-keep-school-level-teacher-ratings-secret-refuse-release-district-wide-administrator-data/ucCKVD6DMU0arTZuofiJLK/story.html">the newspaper writes</a>, which says in turn that it plans to appeal the decision. In previous years, The LA Times and The New York Times have both published similar data.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> has published some <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/07/google-summer-of-code-full-of-stats.html">data</a> about its 2013 <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Summer of Code</a>, its summer program that pays CS students to work on open source projects. For the seventh year in a row, the <strong>University of Moratuwa</strong> in Sri Lanka has the most students participating in the program.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2013/07/01/it-only-takes-about-42-minutes-to-learn-algebra-with-video-games/">Forbes boasted</a> that &ldquo;it only takes about 42 minutes to learn algebra with video games,&rdquo; and this week , another PR piece says that a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.sproglit.com/blog/former-white-house-advisers-educational-app-improves-math-scores-by-11-in-an-hour">Former White House adviser&rsquo;s educational app improves math scores by 11% in an hour</a>.&rdquo; So it sounds to me like we&rsquo;ve pretty much <strong>fixed math education</strong>. Good job, team!</p>
<h2>Non-MOOC&rsquo;d Classes and Programs</h2>
<p>The climate science blog <a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/2013/07/18/david-petraeus-course-syllabus-features-frackademia-readings">DeSmogBlog has obtained a copy</a> of <strong>General Petraeus&rsquo;s syllabus</strong> for his upcoming class at CUNY, &ldquo;The Coming North American Decade(s)?&rdquo; DeSmogBlog describes the contents as &ldquo;Frackademia,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;shorthand for oil and gas industry-funded research costumed as independent economics or science.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2U</strong> and the <strong>University of Berkeley</strong> have partnered for a new, online-only graduate program in Information and Data Science. More details <a href="https://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/uc-berkeley-data-science-masters-program/240158400/">via Information Week</a>.</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>The <strong>NCAA</strong> announced this week that it would not renew its licensing contract with <strong>EA Games</strong>, which has used the likeness of college athletes to market its various video games. The action comes in the midst of a lawsuit by former UCLA basketball star Ed O&rsquo;Bannon who&rsquo;s leading a lawsuit against the NCAA for using college athletes&rsquo; likeness without properly compensating them. There&rsquo;s some speculation that by dropping ties with EA Games, the NCAA is concerned about its chances in the lawsuit, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-ncaa-lawsuit-ea-sports-20130718,0,1889087.story">says The LA Times</a>.</p>
<h2>Surveillance</h2>
<p><strong>Oakland</strong> city officials are <a href="http://cironline.org/reports/oakland-surveillance-center-progresses-amid-debate-privacy-data-collection-4978">moving forward</a> with their plans to build a Domain Awareness Center, &ldquo;a federally funded project to link surveillance cameras, license-plate readers, gunshot detectors, Twitter feeds, alarm notifications and other data into a unified &lsquo;situational awareness&rsquo; tool for law enforcement.&rdquo; Included in the project, data from the Oakland Unified School District.</p>
<p><strong>Northside ISD</strong>, a <strong>San Antonio</strong> school district, says it will <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323664204578609943665353714.html">no longer require students to carry IDs</a> with <strong>RFID</strong> chips implanted in them. Last year, a student unsuccessfully sued the district over the tracking, claiming it violated her religious views. The chips were meant to track attendance, but the district now says that the program didn&rsquo;t increase attendance enough to justify costs.</p>
<p><strong>The Campaign for Reader Privacy</strong>, a joint initiative of the American Booksellers Association, the American Library Association, the Association of American Publishers, and the PEN American Center, issued a <a href="http://readerprivacy.org/news.jsp?id=48">call</a> this week to revise the <strong>Patriot Act</strong> and restore privacy protections that were stripped from libraries and booksellers.</p>
