<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/Udacitycs101.jpg" alt="" align="right" /><a href="http://udacity.com">Udacity</a>, the online learning startup that spun out of Stanford&rsquo;s Artificial Intelligence MOOC last year, is wrapping up its first courses, with final exams due this week and grades soon to follow. After 7 weeks in &ldquo;CS101: Building a Search Engine,&rdquo; I received the end-of-term email from Udacity: &ldquo;Congratulations to those who finished CS101!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m not one of them. I didn&rsquo;t finish the class. I tried keeping up with the videos and exercises, but I gave up on completing the homework weeks ago. Initially I thought I&rsquo;d skip the homework and just take the final. (There were two options for completing the class: a grade based 50% on homework and 50% on the final, or a grade based entirely on the final exam.) But as I fell behind in the watching the videos, I knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to do well on the final. So I gave up. I &ldquo;dropped out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s becoming a fairly standard occurrence for me with my attempts to learn to program through these sorts of online classes. I get the weekly emails from <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> too, for example, reminding me that I left off on &ldquo;Code Year&rdquo; around Week 4 (in other words, around January 30).</p>
<p>My inability to complete these classes does make me look closely at my motivations for signing up in the first place. Sure, it&rsquo;s all under the guise of &ldquo;learning to program,&rdquo; but what exactly does that mean to me? What do I want to learn? What do I want out of these classes? What do I need to get out of these classes to do the sorts of coding that I&rsquo;d do for my job? How is that different from the sorts of knowledge I&rsquo;m interested in simply for the sake of having a better understanding of computer science? And finally, even if I&rsquo;m a highly motivated student (wait, am I?), what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work for me in these informal online learning environments?</p>
<p>There were a lot of things I really liked about Udacity, and frankly when the course opens for sign-ups again, I&rsquo;ll probably re-enroll. But I&rsquo;m also signed up for the CS101 course that Coursera (the other startup that spun out of Stanford&rsquo;s MOOC experiments) is offering. And so we&rsquo;ll see what sticks &ndash; what I like in terms of the instructor, the course design, and the platform via which the class is delivered.</p>
