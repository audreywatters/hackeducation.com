<p style="text-align: left;">History professor Jonathan Rees called it an &ldquo;<a href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/an-uncharacteristically-subtle-post-for-me/">uncharacteristically subtle post</a>.&rdquo; When he posted an excerpt from his university&rsquo;s report on its Blackboard usage, he didn&rsquo;t have to say much: &ldquo;I think all I want to do here is point out that all the things professors use Blackboard for here most (as well as a few of the things that not many people use Blackboard for) can be done for a lot less money than whatever our Blackboard license costs. Sometimes they can be done for no money at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rees asks a really important question: why would a school opt to spend so much money on an LMS when many of its features go unused? Why pay when you can find cheap or free alternatives elsewhere?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much the usage patterns of Rees&rsquo; university match those at other institutions. But if, indeed, people are primarily &ndash; heck, overwhelmingly &ndash; using the LMS to share documents and send announcements, then wow, we need to really look closely at what Google Apps for Education is providing campuses &ndash; a cloud-based document creation, editing, sharing, and storage tool, plus email, calendaring, and social networking &ndash; as well as what it&rsquo;s positioned to provide in the future thanks to APIs and app stores.</p>
