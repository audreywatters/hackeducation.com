<p>As I've watched more <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/world_bank_opens_more_datasets_challenges_develope.php">governments and NGOs</a> start to release datasets and <a href="http://www.civicapps.org/">encourage developers</a> to build tools with the information, I've wondered what sorts of projects would be best suited for a sort of grassroots education hacking.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Few Datasets:</em></strong> <a href="http://131.187.99.20/NEDM_Beta/">National Education Data Model</a> <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> <a href="http://www.data.gov/">Data.gov</a></p>
<p>What other sorts of data could we use?  What sorts of tools do we want to build?  (And please, don't all say "assessment tools" -- let's be more creative than that.)</p>
<p>And how can we involve students in these projects?  What data and tools might interest them?  (I'm rather partial to the <a href="http://cameraseverywhere.us/">Cameras Everywhere</a> project, myself)</p>
