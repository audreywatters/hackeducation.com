<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/arneduncan"><strong>U.S. Secretary of Education</strong> Arne Duncan</a> held his first <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/media-advisories/us-secretary-education-arne-duncan-hold-twitter-town-hall-wednesday"><strong>Twitter</strong> Town Hall</a> on Wednesday.  People were asked to use the #askarne hashtag in order to direct questions to Duncan, which were asked in turn by journalist John Merrow.  The Department of Education has <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2011/08/duncan-takes-to-twitter-to-answer-your-questions/">posted a selection</a> of the Q&amp;A on its website, but watching the Twitter stream on Wednesday, many felt disappointed that the Secretary of Education did not address their questions.</p>
<p>The <strong>ACLU</strong> <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/08/23/139895784/parents-aclu-sue-n-j-city-over-facebook-records?ft=1&amp;f=1013">filed a lawsuit</a> in Newark on Tuesday as the city has refused to release records relating to <strong>Facebook</strong> CEO Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million donation to the city schools.</p>
<p>A judge in <strong>Missouri</strong> has <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/08/26/missouri-teachers-win-injunction-against-anti-social-networking-bill/">issued an injunction</a>, blocking Senate Bill 54 that would ban teacher/student messaging via social networks.</p>
<p><strong>The Beloit College</strong> has released its annual welcome to its incoming class.  This year's freshmen -- <a href="http://www.beloit.edu/mindset/2015/">the class of 2015</a> -- have a certain mindset, the college contends, listing the cultural milestones of these students lives.  This is an important class, as most of them were born in 1993, the same year that Mozaic introduced its Web browser.  This is the beginning of the Internet generation.</p>
<p>The language learning startup <a href="http://busuu.com"><strong>busuu.com</strong></a> has added a special <a href="http://blog.busuu.com/new-busuu-com-dictionary-with-special-audiovisual-features/">audio-visual dictionary</a> for all its languages -- English,Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish and Polish.  The dictionary includes recordings by native speakers as well as pictures to help you visualize the words.</p>
<p>A depressing "chart of the day" from <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/08/chart-of-the-day-student-loans-have-grown-511-since-1999/243821/">The Atlantic</a> shows that <strong>student loan</strong> debt has grown 511% since 1999.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> is conducting a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/accessibility-survey-for-blind-users.html">survey</a> about the accessibility of Google products.  Earlier this year the National Federation of the Blind <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/04/as-schools-shift-to-google-apps-blind-students-object.ars">filed a complaint</a> with the Justice Department claiming that Google Apps for Education had accessibility problems.</p>
<p>According to survey data released this week by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, 7 out of 10 college students have <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/128785/">skipped</a> buying a college textbook because of its price.</p>
<p>A study from the U.K. finds that <a href="http://infodocket.com/2011/08/23/uk-reading-novels-read-monthly-by-less-than-one-in-two-children-7-never-been-to-a-library/">fewer than 50% of children eight to 17</a> read a novel outside class every month, research suggests.  They're more likely to read text messages or email.  (In all fairness, I am more likely to read text messages or email too, but I blame George A. A. Martin's awfully long novels for that speed with which I'm consuming fiction lately.)</p>

<p>One year after its launch, e-textbook app maker <a href="http://inkling.com"><strong>Inkling</strong></a> updated its iPad app to Version 2.0, adding a number of new features.  Inkling's textbooks now include an interesting social feature -- a  <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/08/23/inkling-2-0-when-a-textbook-becomes-more-than-a-textbook/">study group</a> of sorts --</p>

<p>The <strong>Department of Education</strong> has launched <a href="http://www.eddataexpress.ed.gov/">Version 2.0</a> of its education data website, with new tools including a mapping feature, a trend line tool, and a conditional analysis tool.  <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2011/08/education_department_overhauls.html">Ed Week's Sarah Sparks</a> reports that a third update will come this winter and will include more data on the state level.</p>
<p>Dartmouth is apparently struggling with <a href="http://thedartmouth.com/2011/7/26/news/blitz">its move from its old email server</a> to <strong>Microsoft Office 365</strong>.  The university <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/about/notices/">lost service</a> to the productivity suite -- an outage that affected all the school's customers and was the first failure of the Microsoft cloud in over a year.</p>
<p>I have fond memories of <strong>Little Golden Books</strong> -- both as an early reader and as a parent.  Random House says it's bringing the popular  library of books to the digital format, starting with -- of course, The Poky Little Puppy.</p>
<p>"<a href="http://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/russian-educational-system-going-digital/">The Russian educational system is going digial</a>," reports Good E-Reader, pointing to both investment and adoption in e-readers in Russian classrooms.  Bonus points for this quip from Vladimir Putin:  "However, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had a strange word of praise for the Plastic Logic device that a Ministry of Education trial will place in over 1,000 classrooms: the lack of a glass screen will prevent students from being injured during school time brawls. While it isn't clear what kinds of safety issues Putin is alluding to, at least he saw the progressive nature of the device and appears ready to implement state-of-the-art technology in Russian schools.</p>
