<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/06/01/different-approach-private-student-loans">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;<strong>Private student loans</strong> could function more effectively &#8211; and be a more useful tool for helping students pay for postsecondary education &#8211; if lenders made them using criteria such as institutional quality and the likely return on a student&#8217;s investment rather than credit scores and co-signers, the authors of a new report from the American Enterprise Institute argue. The authors, Andrew P. Kelly and Kevin J. James, say that student loans made by non-government lenders &#8211; which have shrunk to under 10 percent of all loans disbursed to students &#8211; could play a more central role if they are were based more on market forces and if they were not backed by significant federal guarantees.&#8221; For what it&#8217;s worth, &#8220;market forces&#8221; have made loan startups one of the most popular areas for VC investment in recent years.</p>

And by not only taking money from an oppressive regime but also naming Yasir Al Rumayyan &#8211; the manager of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund &#8211; to its board, it ups its already impressive list of questionable business tactics to new levels.&#8221;</p>
