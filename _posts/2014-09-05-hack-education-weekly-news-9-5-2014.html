<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>Looks like the<strong> Department of Education </strong><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/09/05/feds-suspect-more-fafsa-errors-will-again-reprocess-forms">screwed up</a> <strong>FAFSA</strong> calculations again for a hundred thousand or so students. Well, at least there aren&rsquo;t any high stakes efforts associated with the Department of Education being able to count and calculate and rate and rank things, right?</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> has <a href="http://www.thewire.com/business/2014/09/google-will-refund-at-least-19-million-for-kids-in-app-purchases/379633/">settled</a> with the <strong>FTC</strong> and will refund some $19 million to accounts in which kids made in-app purchases without parental consent.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong> Governor Jerry Brown has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/us/california-governor-fights-decision-on-teacher-tenure.html">appealed</a> the recent court ruling (<em>Vergara v California</em>) that would have ended <strong>teacher tenure</strong> as it currently works in the state.</p>
<p>The school board in Durham, North Carolina has <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/09/03/345580314/north-carolina-district-breaks-ties-with-teach-for-america">severed ties</a> with <strong>Teach for America</strong>, citing the recruits&rsquo; &ldquo;lack of experience.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h2>
<p><strong>Stanford</strong> CS PhD candidate <a href="http://webpolicy.org/2014/09/04/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-coursera/">Jonathan Mayer posted on Thursday</a> about a series of security flaws he&rsquo;d discovered in <strong>Coursera</strong> while preparing for a class on government surveillance, including:</p>
<blockquote><em>1. Any teacher can dump the entire user database, including over nine million names and email addresses. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>2. If you are logged into your Coursera account, any website that you visit can list your course enrollments.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>3. Coursera&rsquo;s privacy-protecting user IDs don&rsquo;t do much privacy protecting.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> has <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/96686805237/response-to-reported-vulnerability-in-instructor-access">responded</a> (pretty defensively) saying they&rsquo;ve addressed the issues. &ldquo;Given our partnership philosophy, we have focused less effort on deflecting malicious attacks that might be made by one of our trusted partners. This has left open some gaps.&rdquo; I guess $85 million in venture funding buys something other than security and privacy for learners. Go figure.</p>
<p>(For what it's worth, I bet these sorts of <strong>security vulnerabilities</strong> are rampant across ed-tech. Rampant.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Coursera</strong> is now <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/96565445727/coursera-now-accessible-in-sudan-and-cuba">accessible</a> in <strong>Sudan</strong> and <strong>Cuba</strong>, thanks to licensing from the US Department of Treasury. Because &ldquo;open&rdquo; has an asterisk: some restrictions may apply.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/09/04/online-education-platform-edcast-puts-universities-charge-their-content">Edcast</a></strong>, &ldquo;Silicon Valley&rsquo;s latest contribution to the ed-tech space,&rdquo; built on top of the edX open source platform. Kanye shrug.</p>
<p>The <strong>AI</strong> class that started the whole MOOC thing (<em>cough</em>) <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2014/08/intro-to-artificial-intelligence-open.html">is back</a>. That is, <strong>Sebastian Thrun</strong> and <strong>Peter Norvig</strong> are once again offering their AI class &ndash; with a verified certificate &ndash; via <strong>Udacity</strong>.</p>
<h2>Meanwhile on Campus</h2>
<p>You can carry a concealed weapon onto school campuses in <strong>Idaho</strong>. Bonus points if, with the gun in your pocket, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/09/04/instructor-shoots-self-foot-classroom-idaho-state">you shoot yourself during class</a>.</p>
<p>Some 4000 <strong>Starbucks</strong> employees have applied to <strong>Arizona State University</strong>. Bonus points if, as a university president, <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/2014/08/30/grande-starbucks-employees-apply-asu/14892121/#prclt-GMQn1QZT">you can make shitty comments about baristas and English majors</a>.</p>
<p>About 25% of the student population at <strong>Kentucky State University</strong>, a HBCU, are being <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/09/04/kentucky-state-u-hbcu-drops-quarter-its-students-unpaid-bills">kicked out</a> for failing to pay their fees.</p>

<p><strong>Purdue University</strong> will <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/09/05/purdue-create-competency-based-bachelors-degree">create</a> a competency-based bachelor&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>Colleges have licensed <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/culture/society/college-jello-shots">their logos</a> to <strong>Jell-O</strong> for shot molds and to <strong>Franklin</strong> for peer pong balls. Because higher education.</p>
<h2>Go, School Sports Team!</h2>
<p>Researchers at Division 1 school <strong>Vanderbilt University</strong> find that multimillion dollar salaries for college football coaches are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/sports/ncaafootball/researchers-see-football-coaches-as-ceos.html">totally worth it</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Durrell Chamorro</strong>, who played football at <strong>Colorado State University</strong>, has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/09/03/former-football-player-sues-ncaa-over-old-scholarship-rules">filed a class action lawsuit</a> &ldquo;seeking damages for football players who were affected by the NCAA&rsquo;s longstanding rule banning multiyear scholarships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A <strong>University of Texas</strong> student was <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/news/ut-student-detained-who-flew-drone-over-stadium-du/nhDLW/">detained</a> for flying a drone over football game.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years after a student accused <strong>Florida State University</strong>&rsquo;s star quarterback <strong>Jameis Winston</strong> of sexually assaulting her, the university says it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/sports/ncaafootball/jameis-winston-case-said-to-be-subject-of-florida-state-inquiry.html">launched an inquiry</a>.</p>

<h2>Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0914/morningeducation15134.html">Politico writes about the revamped <strong>GED</strong></a>, now offered as a computer-based-test by a for-profit venture between <strong>Pearson</strong> and the <strong>American Council on Education</strong>. &ldquo;The pass rate on the old GED hovered around 72 percent and dipped only slightly after the last major revision to the exam in 2002. The new exam, aligned to the Common Core, is meant to be much harder - and indeed, just 53 percent of test-takers have passed.&rdquo; And &ldquo;through the end of July, just 105,000 students had taken the new GED. In a typical year, 750,000 students take the test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because education companies make sure they can profit from almost every aspect of bullshit education policy: &ldquo;<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2014/09/tutoring_companies_stand_to_ca.html"><strong>Tutoring Companies</strong> Stand to Cash In on States That Lose Waivers</a>.&rdquo;</p>
