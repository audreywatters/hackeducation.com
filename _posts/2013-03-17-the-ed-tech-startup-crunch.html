<p>Following the slew of recent startup <a href="http://blog.edmodo.com/2013/03/05/edmodo-acquires-education-technology-start-up-root-1/">acquisitions</a>, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/shift-happens-junyo-changes-course">pivots</a>, <a href="https://formspring.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/formspring-is-shutting-down/">closures</a>, and <a href="http://rafaelcorrales.tumblr.com/post/44303113482/the-adventure-continues">resignations</a> (along with a couple of emails from entrepreneurs hinting that their company is weighing some of these options), I thought I&rsquo;d take a look back at the last few years&rsquo; worth of ed-tech startup history:</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s been funded? How much and by whom? What&rsquo;s happened since? Who&rsquo;s been acquired? Who&rsquo;s pivoted? Who&rsquo;s shuttered? Who&rsquo;s got a (sustainable) revenue model? Who&rsquo;s been in the headlines (and why)? Who&rsquo;s been ignored by the press? Who&rsquo;s been forgotten by bloggers and users alike?</p>
<h2>Ed-Tech and Crunchbase</h2>
<p>While far from the perfect source to answer these questions, Techcrunch&rsquo;s <a href="http://crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a> does provide a decent amount of data about startups&rsquo; funding, staffing, and media coverage. Anyone can edit the Crunchbase database, so there are lots of gaps and messiness in the data. But (for better or worse) it&rsquo;s a free, tech-community-supported effort &mdash; one that some folks worried would fall into disrepair after AOL acquired Techcrunch. (It does look like the company is putting some resources into Crunchbase, <a href="http://info.crunchbase.com/2013/02/13/developer-jobs-at-crunchbase/">hiring developers</a> and &mdash; gasp! &mdash; <a href="http://info.crunchbase.com/2013/03/07/research-accelerating/">blogging</a>.)</p>
<p>You can query Crunchbase directly through the website&rsquo;s search interface (that works well for looking up a company or two), or you can utilize the API to pull the data you want.</p>
<p>Thanks to (a lot of) help from my partner <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, I chose the latter, pulling the data I wanted via the Crunchbase API . You can read Kin&rsquo;s thoughts on working with the Crunchbase API <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2013/03/16/using-the-crunchbase-api/">here</a>. He cites me as calling the process &ldquo;tedious&rdquo; &mdash; which if you know me is a well-censored description of how I&rsquo;d describe the endeavor.</p>
<p>For my research, I pulled information on all startups tagged &ldquo;education&rdquo; that have been founded or funded since 2009 &mdash; the year when we started to see this recent resurgence in ed-tech entrepreneurship (as well, I confess, as the year that I founded this blog).</p>
<h2>Crunching Startup Data</h2>
<p>Based on Crunchbase data, I can give you the list of the startups who&rsquo;ve received the most funding in recent years (I should note again, as I state above, that this is crowdsourced and incomplete data):</p>

<p>25. <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/revolution-prep">Revolution Prep (total raised:&nbsp;<span>$15,000,000)</span></a></p>
<p>But that list is really not that interesting...</p>
<p>What I'm more interested in: what about those startups who&rsquo;ve raised between $800,000 and $5 million since 2009? Where are they now? What are their prospects &mdash; for sustainability, for acquisition?</p>
<p>Other questions: which investors are &ldquo;doing well&rdquo; in ed-tech startup-land? Which investors are furthering which education policies (CCSS, NCLB, RTTT, etc) with their funding? In other words, does investment follow policy? Does investment lead policy? Are trends like &ldquo;data-driven education,&rdquo; for example. market-driven? Policy-driven? Investor-driven?</p>
<p>Which metrics are the startup ecosystem tracking that give us the <em>wrong</em> signals for which education startups are interesting or important or tranformative? Which signals do investors (and by extension Crunchbase and Techcrunch&hellip; to name a few) follow that do not mean much when it comes to questions of learning, equity, justice? (i.e. user sign-ups, funding amounts)?</p>
<p>And finally, how can I make my research on this topic more relevant? What questions should I be asking of the Crunchbase(ish) data? What questions does this data fail to answer? How can I make this research and data open and accessible to others?</p>
