<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>Expanding on President Obama&#8217;s plan for two years of free community college education, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/20/bernie-sanders-calls-two-tuition-free-years-all-public-colleges-and-universities">proposing</a> &#8220;the federal government &#8230; give $18 billion a year in dollar-for-dollar matching grants to states, which he says would allow them to slash public college tuition by 55 percent. He said this would apply to students at all public universities and colleges.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wisconsin governor (and likely presidential candidate) Scott Walker does not have a college degree. Cue the think-pieces: "<a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/2/14/8039773/why-scott-walkers-lack-of-a-college-diploma-doesnt-matter">Why Scott Walker's lack of a college diploma doesn't matter.</a>" And &#8220;<a href="http://www.psmag.com/politics-and-law/scott-walker-and-the-politics-of-the-diploma">Graduating university isn&#8217;t evidence of leadership. Neither is not graduating</a>.&#8221; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.wral.com/arkansas-lawmakers-order-schools-to-teach-cursive-writing/14458539/">If the governor signs the bill</a>, Arkansas will soon require students in public schools in the state be taught cursive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/02/19/illinois-governor-seeks-nearly-387m-higher-ed-cuts">From Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;Illinois&#8217;s new governor, Bruce Rauner, this week proposed a $387 million cut to the state&#8217;s higher education budget. About $209 million of that will come from the University of Illinois &#8211; that&#8217;s nearly one-third of the system&#8217;s state subsidy.&#8221;</p>

<p>A handful of student activists occupied the headquarters of Newark Public Schools, <a href="http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2015/02/live_newark_student_activists_occupy_district_offi.html">protesting</a> the leadership of superintendent Cami Anderson and demanding her resignation.</p>

<p>An Oklahoma legislative committee voted this week to ban the teaching of AP US History in the state, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/education/2015/02/17/3623683/oklahoma-lawmakers-vote-overwhleming-ban-advanced-placement-history-class/">arguing</a> that the curriculum was un-patriotic. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/18/387302710/oklahoma-may-scrap-ap-history-for-focusing-on-americas-bad-parts">More via NPR</a>.</p>

<p>The Jefferson County School Board, where students protested last year after it said it was going to review the AP US History curriculum to make sure it sufficiently promoted patriotism, <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/02/19/denver-area-school-board-wont-review-ap_ap.html">now says</a> it that plans no such review.</p>

<p>A legislative committee in Arizona is moving forward with an effort to <a href="http://tucson.com/news/local/education/lawmakers-vote-to-dismantle-common-core/article_a3cfefa9-8a9b-5eea-ae97-e9bd44a90f67.html">dump the Common Core</a> (and its associated tests) in that state.</p>

<h3>OMG LAUSD</h3>
<br />
<p>Looks like LAUSD cannot afford one iPad (or computer) for every student and staff after all. Instead, the Superintendent Ramon Cortines <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-la-school-district--computers-20150220-story.html">said</a> &#8220;the L.A. Unified School District will try to provide computers to students when needed for instruction and testing.&#8221;</p>

<h3>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h3>
<br />
<p>&#8220;The New York Times and CIG Education Group have come together to launch NYT EDUcation, a new education initiative,&#8221; <a href="http://investors.nytco.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2015/The-New-York-Times-and-CIG-Education-Group-Collaborate-on-New-Education-Initiative/default.aspx">says the press release</a>. &#8220;NYT EDUcation will provide innovative courses and programs covering a wide array of subjects, including communications and media, which reflect the authoritative content and intellectual breadth of The New York Times.&#8221; Oh I sure hope David Brooks or Thomas Friedman offer a class on NYT coverage of MOOCs.</p>

<h3>Meanwhile on Campus</h3>
<br />
<p>The University of Illinois Urbana Champaign issued DMCA takedowns over students&#8217; computer science homework that had been posted to GitHub. The university later <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/02/university-bans-github-homework-changes-mind">backed down</a>, apparently recognizing the importance of open source and open collaboration. More on the story <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/19/u-illinois-urbana-champaign-backs-down-legal-threat-against-code-repository">in Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>

<p>The State Department said it was <a href="http://coreyrobin.com/2015/02/14/state-department-expresses-surprise-over-umass-policy/">surprised</a> to learn that UMass was banning Iranian students from its engineering programs. The school later <a href="http://coreyrobin.com/2015/02/18/we-won-umass-backs-down/">reversed its policy</a>.</p>

<p>William Scheide has <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S42/38/60E50/index.xml?section=featured">bequeathed</a> his rare books collection to Princeton University. Appraised at $300 million, it&#8217;s the largest gift in the university&#8217;s history.</p>

<p>Oops. Carnegie Mellon sent 800 students letters telling them they&#8217;d been admitted to its prestigious CS program &#8211; <a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/02/17/carnegie-mellon-erroneously-se.html">in error</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/nyregion/yale-restricts-a-fraternity-after-sexual-misconduct.html">Via The New York Times</a>: &#8220;A Yale fraternity has been banned from conducting on-campus activities until August 2016 as punishment for violating the universityâ€™s sexual misconduct policy at an initiation ceremony last year and then trying to impede the resulting investigation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As gun rights advocates push to legalize firearms on college campuses, an argument is taking shape: Arming female students will help reduce sexual assaults,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/us/in-bid-to-allow-guns-on-campus-weapons-are-linked-to-fighting-sexual-assault.html">says The New York Times</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article10124579.html">According to the Sacramento Bee</a>, &#8220;The California Student Aid Commission has halted funding for Heald College after the for-profit chain failed to provide required documents demonstrating that it is financially stable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The financial aid director at North Idaho College was arrested this month and fired for offering to trade scholarships for sex with a student,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/20/financial-aid-director-north-idaho-college-arrested-offering-scholarships-sex">reports Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/jon-solomon/25067832/freshman-ineligibility-ncaa-commissioners-at-least-considering-it">Via CBS Sports</a>: &#8220;Several conference commissioners say it&#8217;s time to consider making freshmen &#8211; or at least some of them &#8211; ineligible, again, for the first time since the NCAA rule changed in 1972.&#8221;</p>
