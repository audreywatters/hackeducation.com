<p>ACLU, "<a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty/dont-let-schools-chip-your-kids">Don't Let Schools Chip Your Kids</a>" -- Preschoolers in Richmond, California were recently given jerseys with RFID chips so they could be tracked while at school.  I don't like tech fear-mongering, but I do think there are lots of privacy and security concerns we need to consider before we start radio-chipping school supplies, let alone kids.</p>
<p>Lawrence Bowdish, "<a href="http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/origins/article.cfm?articleid=44&amp;articlepage=6&amp;altcontent=no">The Kids Aren't Alright:  The Policymaking of Student Loan Debt</a>" -- The opening sentence of this article speaks volumes:  "In most states, two crimes have a statute of limitations of more than seven years.
