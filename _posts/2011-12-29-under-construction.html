<p>I'm taking advantage of the last week of the year to cross a bunch of tasks off my To Do list. That includes moving my domains off of <a href="http://godaddyboycott.org/">GoDaddy</a>.  It actually shouldn't have come to this ("this" being the company's support of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">SOPA</a>), and I should have long ago taken my business of registering domains and handling DNS elsewhere.  Whatever.  It's done now...</p>
<p>There are other tweaks happening under the hood of Hack Education this week too.  So if you find that the blog or its feeds or its links don't work, feel free to let me know. I will, of course, blame IT.  But then IT'll fix it.</p>
