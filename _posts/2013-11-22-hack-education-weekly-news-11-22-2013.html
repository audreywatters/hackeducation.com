<h2>MOOCs: &ldquo;Not Dead Yet&rdquo;</h2>
<p>For those ready to dance on the grave of MOOCs following <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3021473/udacity-sebastian-thrun-uphill-climb"><strong>Udacity</strong>&rsquo;s &ldquo;pivot&rdquo;</a> last week, well&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/67777181974/coursera-receives-20-million-in-funding-to-create-and">announced today</a> that it has raised another $20 million in investment. This brings to $63 million the Series B funding that the company raised in July (and $85 million total). Part of this latest cash influx comes from three unnamed universities. Any bets on which ones?</p>
<p>This funding news throws cold water on Higher Education Strategy Associates&rsquo; <a href="http://higheredstrategy.com/the-future-of-moocs-coursera-and-edx/">Alex Usher</a>, who speculated this week that <strong>Coursera</strong> is burning through its funding at such a rapid rate that it only has &ldquo;maybe 15 months before the VCs pull the plug.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/moocs-are-reaching-only-privileged-learners-survey-finds/48567">According to a survey</a> undertaken by the <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong> of students enrolled in its <strong>Coursera</strong> classes, 80% of respondents already had a 4-year degree. 44% had some graduate education. You can read the full study <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2350964">here</a>.</p>
<p>Kris Olds has &ldquo;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/globalhighered/mapping-courseras-global-footprint">mapped <strong>Coursera</strong>&rsquo;s global footprint</a>,&rdquo; showing where the MOOC startup has struck partnerships and where the participants in Coursera classes come from.</p>
<p>Frustrated by the deals that its administration has struck with MOOC providers, the faculty at <strong>San Jose State</strong> is weighing a measure that would, <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/143137/">according to The Chronicle</a>, &ldquo;forbid the university to sign contracts with outside technology providers without the approval of tenured and tenure-track faculty members in whatever department would be affected.&rdquo; (Initially schedule for a vote early this week, the measure has been tabled <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/citing-series-of-conflicts-san-jose-state-u-asks-for-governance-review/48427">&rsquo;til December</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Udacity</strong> continues its roll-out of training in corporate tech, this week with classes to help you <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2013/11/app-development-with-salesforcecom.html">build apps on the Salesforce platform</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/11/20/courseras-ed-tech-enterprise-play.html">According to a story in the Silicon Valley Business Journal</a>, <strong>Coursera</strong> too might be weighing a move into corporate training. &ldquo;We think that many companies view Coursera as a quality, convenient, inexpensive way to continue employee development,&rdquo; Andrew Ng told the publication.</p>
<p><strong>MITx</strong> <a href="http://mitopencourseware.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/mitx-announces-new-aeronautics-xseries-certificate-pricing-for-xseries-programs/">unveiled</a> its third XSeries certificate (this one in aeronatics. The other two are &ldquo;Fundamentals of Computer Science&rdquo; and &ldquo;Supply Chain Management.&rdquo;) It also announced the pricing for the XSeries Courses: $50 for short courses and $100 for longer courses. (You can still audit for free.)</p>

<h2>Education Politics</h2>
<p>Speaking to a group of school superintendents,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/11/16/arne-duncan-white-surburban-moms-upset-that-common-core-shows-their-kids-arent-brilliant/">US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan</a>&nbsp;spoke about the growing opposition to the <strong>Common Core State Standards</strong>, noting that it means that there are &ldquo;white suburban moms who &mdash; all of a sudden &mdash; their child isn&rsquo;t as brilliant as they thought they were, and their school isn&rsquo;t quite as good as they thought they were.&rdquo; Cue outrage.</p>
<p>Several states have slowed their roll-outs of assessments aligned with the <strong>Common Core State Standards</strong>.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/state_edwatch/2013/11/two-year_transition_to_common-core_tests_approved_in_massachusetts.html">Massachusetts</a></strong>&nbsp;has opted for a two-year transition, saying that&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2013/11/massachusetts_wont_require_all.html">students won&rsquo;t have to take the PARCC exams until 2015</a>.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/state_edwatch/2013/11/la_k-12_chief_announces_10-year_timeline_for_common-core_accountability.html">Louisiana</a></strong>&nbsp;is moving even more slowly, with a ten-year transition period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of Education released a report on the <strong>School Improvement Grant</strong> program, which is meant to turn-around the country&rsquo;s lowest-performing schools. But the SIG program gets mixed results, <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2013/11/us_department_of_education_ana.html">according to this latest news</a>, with a third of schools actually performing worse.</p>
<p>The Department of Education <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2013/11/high_schools_to_compete_for_10.html">unveiled</a> a $100 million <strong>Race-to-the-Top</strong>-ish contest for high schools that work with colleges and employers.</p>
<p>Democratic Senators Christopher Murphy of Connecticut and Brian Schatz of Hawaii say they plan to put forward legislation that would make it easier for <strong>competency-based programs</strong> to gain access to federal funding. More details <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/22/2-democrats-plan-legislation-promote-competency-based-ed-and-rate-colleges">via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.news-leader.com/article/20131120/NEWS11/311200120/Missouri-education-chief-advised-ballot-group">Email records show</a> that <strong>Missouri</strong>&rsquo;s education commissioner helped advise on a ballot campaign that would have ended tenure for public school teachers in the state.</p>

<p>The <strong>Texas State Board of Education</strong> <a href="http://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/texas-board-of-ed-votes-to-drop-algebra-ii-mandate">gave preliminary approval</a> this week to dropping <strong>Algebra II</strong> as a requirement for high school students in the state to graduate.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Justice </strong>says that it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/justice-department-louisiana-voucher-program-100072.html?hp=l18">dropping</a> its attempts to block <strong>Louisiana</strong>&rsquo;s <strong>school voucher</strong> program, which it claimed earlier this year were interfering with school desegregation in the state.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/local/gao-report-on-dc-school-vouchers/598/">a report by the GAO</a>, <strong>DC</strong>&rsquo;s <strong>school voucher</strong> program, which uses tax dollars for low-income students to attend private schools, lacks sufficient oversight.</p>

But this week, <a href="http://googlescholar.blogspot.com/2013/11/google-scholar-library.html">Google launched</a> &ldquo;Scholar Library, your personal collection of articles in Scholar. You can save articles right from the search page, organize them by topic, and use the power of Scholar&rsquo;s full-text search &amp; ranking to quickly find just the one you want - at any time and from anywhere.&rdquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t get toooooo comfortable with another free tool from Google. But hey. That&rsquo;s just me.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong>&nbsp;student senate is pushing for a rule on campus that would require that student information systems procured by the university have an&nbsp;<strong>API</strong>.

Jane McGonigal, who&rsquo;s written a book making a similar argument, tweeted a link to the story and garnered over 3500 retweets. But oh. Wait.
