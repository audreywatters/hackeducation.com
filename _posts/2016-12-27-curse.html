<p>My latest book is now available for purchase.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://monsters3.hackeducation.com"><strong>The Curse of the Monsters of Education Technology</strong></a></em> is the latest in my &#8220;monsters of ed-tech&#8221; series &#8211; a sequel to <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em> (2014) and <em>The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</em> (2015). Like those two books, this new one is a collection of all the keynotes and talks I delivered in 2016 &#8211; seven altogether.</p>

<p>E-book versions are available for purchase for $4.99 via the usual online retailers: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N6KR81D">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/691935">Smashwords</a>. Even better (as far as my royalties go at least): you can buy from me directly <a href="https://gumroad.com/products/uqxVR">via Gumroad</a>. </p>

<p>Coming soon: print and audio versions.</p>
