<h2>MOOCs</h2>
<p>This is the way "<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/11/29/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-moocs/">Year Two of the <strong>MOOCs</strong></a>" ends. Not with a bang but a whimper. Hell, not even a whimper. No MOOC news this week!</p>
<h2>Education and The Law</h2>
<p>Queen Elizabeth II <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25495315">pardoned</a> the computer pioneer <strong>Alan Turing</strong> on Christmas Eve. Despite his crucial role in helping the Allies in World War II, Turing had been convicted of homosexuality in 1952, and he committed suicide after being chemically castrated.</p>
<p><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/sherlock-holmes-is-in-the-public-domain-american-judge-rules/">A judge has ruled</a> that <strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong> (and the other characters and elements of Arthur Conan Doyle&rsquo;s series) is no longer covered by US copyright law and is now in the public domain.</p>
<p>A lawsuit that attempts to block the implementation of <strong>InBloom</strong> in <strong>New York</strong> will be heard in the state Superior Court on January 10. Twelve parents have requested a restraining order to prohibit the state from uploading student data to inBloom. More details in <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2013/12/new_york_battle_over_inBloom_data_privacy_heading_to_court.html">Education Week</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_24802410/judge-douglas-county-school-district-violated-fair-campaign">A judge has ruled</a> that the Douglas County (<strong>Colorado</strong>) school district &ldquo;violated the state&rsquo;s Fair Campaign Practices Act when it hired <strong>Rick Hess</strong> to author a positive report about school reforms that it later e-mailed to 85,000 subscribers in the weeks before the November election.&rdquo; All&rsquo;s fair in</p>
<h2>Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, <strong>Amplify</strong>&rsquo;s massive tablet implementation in <strong>North Carolina</strong> ran into issues when there were reports of overheating chargers and broken displays. But &ldquo;a lengthy investigation by an independent lab has found no safety issues with the chargers,&rdquo; so <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-12-23-amplify-tablet-rollout-to-continue-after-investigation">some schools are resuming their usage</a>.</p>
<p>The for-profit college <strong>Oakbridge Academy of the Arts</strong> shut down last week &ndash; unexpectedly and immediately. More details in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/19/oakbridge-academy-of-arts-for-profit-shut-down_n_4462005.html">The Huffington Post</a>.</p>
<h2>Funding and Acquisitions</h2>
<p><strong>Floqq</strong> has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-12-20-floqq-raises-550k-for-latin-american-online-video-marketplace">raised</a> $550,000 in funding for its online video course marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>The Gates Foundation</strong> has updated its <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database">database</a> with many new grants it&rsquo;s awarded. A few of the notable education ones: $4 million to Summit Public Schools and $4.2 to Green Dot Public Schools, both public charter schools.</p>
<p><strong>Rosetta Stone</strong> has acquired the &ldquo;brain training&rdquo; company <strong>Vivity Labs</strong>, <a href="http://www.edukwest.com/rosetta-stone-acquires-vivity-labs-enters-hot-brain-training-vertical/">reports Kirsten Winkler</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-12-26-headsprout-goes-to-learning-a-z">According to Edsurge</a>, <strong>HeadSprout</strong> has been acquired by <strong>Learning A-Z</strong>. (HeadSprout was acquired earlier this year by a private equity firm.)</p>
<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p><strong>Philipp Schmidt</strong>, the co-founder of <strong>P2PU</strong>, is <a href="http://info.p2pu.org/2013/12/21/thank-you/">stepping down</a> from his role as the Executive Director from the online learning community in order to take a job at the MIT Media Lab.</p>
<p>Former NFL star <strong>Deion Sanders</strong> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2013/12/26/deion-sanders-to-be-rehired-again-at-charter-school-he-founded/">has been rehired</a> at the charter school he co-founded. He was fired in early December. He&rsquo;d been fired in October too, but was rehired then as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/you-know-who-else-uses-unpaid-interns-colleges-and-universities">ProPublica continues its investigation</a> into <strong>unpaid internships</strong>, this time focusing on the number of colleges and universities who fail to pay their interns.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/send-academic-job-candidates-to-mla-in-chicago-to-interview-with-uc-riverside">IndieGogo campaign</a> to help send academic job candidates to the <strong>MLA</strong> to interview with <strong>UC Riverside</strong>. The crowdfunding effort comes on the heels of <a href="http://pankisseskafka.com/2013/12/20/naming-and-shaming-uc-riverside-english-gives-candidates-3-days-notice/">revelations that UC Riverside</a> will only give candidates 5 days notice that they&rsquo;re expected to be in Chicago for an interview.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Fish</strong> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/opinion/fish-so-long-its-been-good-to-know-you.html">retired</a> from his New York Times op-ed column. So that&rsquo;s one less hate-read for us literature folks. (Now if Friedman and Brooks could just resign&hellip;)</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p><strong>Stanford</strong> researchers have <a href="http://threatpost.com/stanford-researchers-find-connecting-metadata-with-user-names-is-simple/103272">demonstrated</a> that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to connect metadata with user names. Most of the reports on this finding link it to the NSA claims that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;just&rdquo; collecting metadata. But I think there are interesting implications for education too.</p>
<p>And in other &ldquo;They have your data!&rdquo; news, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/12/snapchat-exploit-may-let-hackers-connect-names-and-phone-numbers-in-bulk/">an exploit in <strong>Snapchat</strong></a> can make users&rsquo; names and phone numbers available &ndash; a trove of data about the under&ndash;18 set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than 40 teachers in <strong>DC</strong> public schools received incorrect evaluations for 2012&ndash;2013 because of errors in the way the scores were calculated and one was fired as a result.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/23/errors-found-in-d-c-teacher-evaluations/">Oops</a>.</p>
<p>Actual headline in <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/12/131210-ipad-learning-education-space-science/">The National Geographic</a>: &ldquo;<strong>iPads</strong> Improve Classroom Learning, Study Finds.&rdquo; Sigh.</p>
