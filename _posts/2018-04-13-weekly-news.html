<p>School administration software-maker <strong>Connexeo</strong> has raised <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-04-09-education-administration-and-payment-company-connexeo-raises-110-million">$110 million</a> from Great Hill Partners.</p>

The company sells a tablet for use in prison. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/08/edovo-raises-9-million-to-provide-incarcerated-people-with-tablet-based-education/">Here&#8217;s how Techcrunch describes it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edovo works with facilities to bring in secure wireless networks and tablets that access Edovo’s educational platform. The incentive-based learning program covers a variety of areas, including literacy, college course work, cognitive behavioral therapy and vocational training. Upon completion of certain lessons, incarcerated individuals can receive certificates and entertainment options. They can also use Edovo to stay in touch with their loved ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ed-tech as surveillance and punishment and behavioral management. It&#8217;s not just for schools. Anyway. Edovo, which describes itself as &#8220;the most innovative carceral technology solution on the market,&#8221; has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jail-education-solutions">$12.3 million</a> total. </p>

<p><strong>Holberton School</strong> has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/holberton-raises-8m-for-its-full-stack-engineering-school/">$8 million</a> from daphni, Trinity Ventures, and the Omidyar Network. The coding bootcamp has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/holberton-school">$12.5 million</a> total.</p>

<p><strong>BookNook</strong> has raised <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-04-11-booknook-books-another-2m-to-expand-digital-group-reading-platform">$2 million</a> from Better Ventures, the Urban Innovation Fund, Reach Capital, Impact Engine, Kapor Capital, Redhouse Education, and Edovate Capital.

<p>The big &#8220;business of ed-tech&#8221; news of the week: <strong>Edmodo</strong> has been <a href="https://blog.edmodo.com/2018/04/08/edmodo-is-joining-the-netdragon-family/">acquired</a> by Chinese game-maker <strong>NetDragon</strong>. NetDragon will pay $137.5 million for the company &#8211; but of that just $15 million is cash; the rest is equity in NetDragon. Edmodo had raised some <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-04-09-china-s-netdragon-to-acquire-edmodo-for-137-5-million">$77.5 million</a> in venture capital according to Crunchbase (<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-04-09-china-s-netdragon-to-acquire-edmodo-for-137-5-million">$100 million according to Edsurge</a>). Either way, it&#8217;s not a good look, and not a good ending. As <a href="https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/04/12/1523509200000/EdTech-fails-to-pay--again/">The Financial Times puts it</a>, &#8220;EdTech fails to pay, again.&#8221;</p>
