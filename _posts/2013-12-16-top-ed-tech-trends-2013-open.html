<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 8 of my <a href="http://hackeducation.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=ed-tech%20trends%202013">Top 10 Ed-Tech Trends of 2013</a> series</em></p>
<p><a title="Boheken Heart, Bologna by flatworldsedge, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flatworldsedge/5208973775/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5084/5208973775_f0b6039b21.jpg" alt="Boheken Heart, Bologna" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>As with the trend of &ldquo;data,&rdquo; &ldquo;open&rdquo; is something I&rsquo;ve touched upon in each of my annual year-end reviews (in <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/15/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2011-open/">2011</a> and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/07/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-the-battle-to-open-textbooks/">2012</a>. Again, I recommend reading those posts to gain a sense of past, present, and future).</p>
<p>In some ways the two &ndash;&ldquo;data&rdquo; and &ldquo;open&rdquo; &ndash; represent opposite directions in ed-tech: the former towards a consolidation of power; the latter towards its distribution. The former towards an extraction of value from the learning community, from the public; the latter towards the cultivation of a commons.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a terrible over-simplication, in part because both &ldquo;open&rdquo; and &ldquo;data&rdquo; have become so deeply intertwined in what Evgeny Morozov in <em>To Save Everything Click Here</em> calls &ldquo;technological solutionism&rdquo; &ndash; this notion that technology can provide us with simple answers (in this case, with more data or more openness) to complicated questions we can&rsquo;t fully articulate or haven&rsquo;t fully explored. (My review of his book as it pertains to ed-tech is <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/03/26/ed-tech-solutionism-morozov/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>In addition to the publication of his book this year, Morozov also penned a particularly brutal critique of Tim O&rsquo;Reilly, coiner of the term &ldquo;Web 2.0,&rdquo; champion of open source and open government, and, in Morozov&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler">Meme Hustler</a>.&rdquo; Morozov&rsquo;s article &ndash; both very long and very harsh &ndash; raises important questions about the politics of software, the rhetoric of openness, and an embrace of &ldquo;algorithmic regulation.&rdquo; What do the forces of &ldquo;big data&rdquo; and &ldquo;openness&rdquo; have in common? What are the politics of &ldquo;open,&rdquo; or is &ldquo;open&rdquo; often simply a substitute for politics?</p>
<h2>What is &ldquo;Open&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>Morozov writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Few words in the English language pack as much ambiguity and sexiness as &ldquo;open.&rdquo; And after O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s bombastic interventions&mdash;&ldquo;Open allows experimentation. Open encourages competition. Open wins,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/22/kindle-oreilly-ebooks-technology-breakthroughs_oreilly.html">he once proclaimed in an essay</a>&mdash;its luster has only intensified. Profiting from the term&rsquo;s ambiguity, O&rsquo;Reilly and his collaborators likened the &ldquo;openness&rdquo; of open source software to the &ldquo;openness&rdquo; of the academic enterprise, markets, and free speech. &ldquo;Open&rdquo; thus could mean virtually anything, from &ldquo;open to intellectual exchange&rdquo; (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000119094723/http://sunworld.com/sunworldonline/swol-01-1999/swol-01-regex-2.html">O&rsquo;Reilly in 1999</a>: &ldquo;Once you start thinking of computer source code as a human language, you see open source as a variety of &lsquo;free speech&rsquo;&rdquo;) to &ldquo;open to competition&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4179">O&rsquo;Reilly in 2000</a>: &ldquo;For me, &lsquo;open source&rsquo; in the broader sense means any system in which open access to code lowers the barriers to entry into the market&rdquo;).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open&rdquo; allowed O&rsquo;Reilly to build the largest possible tent for the movement. The language of economics was less alienating than Stallman&rsquo;s language of ethics; &ldquo;openness&rdquo; was the kind of multipurpose term that allowed one to look political while advancing an agenda that had very little to do with politics. <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/04/handicapping-internet-platform-wars.html">As O&rsquo;Reilly put it in 2010</a>, &ldquo;the art of promoting openness is not to make it a moral crusade, but rather to highlight the competitive advantages of openness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not surprisingly, Morozov&rsquo;s article about Tim O&rsquo;Reilly wasn&rsquo;t well-received in many open government, open source, and open data circles. Tim O&rsquo;Reilly is a well-liked guy, not simply a powerful one. But Morozov&rsquo;s provocations are important, I&rsquo;d argue (even if folks feel they&rsquo;re impolite) as the adjective &ldquo;open&rdquo; becomes ascendant, or indeed, <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/changing-narrative/">as &ldquo;open&rdquo; wins</a>.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Open&rdquo; &ldquo;Wins&rdquo;</h2>

</ul>
<p>See. &ldquo;Open&rdquo; gets weird&hellip;</p>
<h2>Openwashing</h2>
<p>In the face of &ldquo;open&rdquo; triumphs, we also saw this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/11/29/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-moocs/">MOOCs galore</a> &ndash; the incredible hype over something often far afield from its origins within open education. &ldquo;An Avalanche is Coming&rdquo; warned Sir Michael Barber, Katelyn Donnelly and Saad Rizvi (all employees of Pearson Education) in a <a href="http://www.ippr.org/images/media/files/publication/2013/04/avalanche-is-coming_Mar2013_10432.pdf">report</a> issued in March that argues MOOCs would bring about a (profitable) revolution in education. Once upon a time the &ldquo;open&rdquo; in MOOC referred not simply to &ldquo;open enrollment&rdquo; but also to &ldquo;OER&rdquo; and/or to &ldquo;<a href="http://davecormier.com/edblog/2013/04/12/what-do-you-mean-open/">open negotiation among learners as to the direction of the course itself</a>.&rdquo; In 2013, the &ldquo;open&rdquo; in MOOC more often referred to the startups who were &ldquo;open for business&rdquo; &ndash; Coursera and Udacity to name just two. And to invoke <a href="http://youtu.be/kIzA4ItynYw">Gardner Campbell&rsquo;s 2012 OpenEd keynote</a>, that&rsquo;s not what we meant at all.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rubbing more salt in that wound, Udacity <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2013/09/announcing-launch-of-open-education.html">unveiled</a> its &ldquo;Open Education Alliance,&rdquo; an industry alliance to support tech training, <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2922">prompting David Wiley go all Willy Wonka with an angry response</a>: &ldquo;&lsquo;Wrong, Sir! WRONG! &hellip; You get nothing!&rsquo; &hellip; there is nothing whatsoever &lsquo;open&rsquo; about the &lsquo;Open&rsquo; Education Alliance.&rdquo;</li>

<h2>What We Lost</h2>

<p>On January 11, Aaron Swartz took his own life. It&rsquo;s a death that has loomed over the entire year &ndash; for me, at least. It&rsquo;s a loss that colors how I frame &ldquo;open&rdquo; and &ldquo;data&rdquo; and &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; and the politics of all of the above.</p>
<p>Swartz was a hacker; he was an activist. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/22/3898584/aaron-swartz-profile-memory-to-myth">He had played a role while still a teenager in the creation of RSS, Creative Commons, Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>He was 26.</p>
<p><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/reddit-co-founder-charged-with-data-theft/">Swartz was indicted in 2011</a> for downloading millions of academic articles from a JSTOR database through an Internet connection in the MIT library. He was charged multiple felony counts &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Aaron_Swartz">two counts of wire fraud and 11 violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> &ndash; and faced up to 35 years in prison and over $1 million in fines.</p>
<p>As investigations into Swartz&rsquo;s death unfolded, it became clear that federal prosecutors had been quite <a href="http://rt.com/usa/swartz-prosecutors-vindictive-behavior-413/">vindictive</a> and <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V133/N29/swartz/reifletter.html">MIT</a> quite <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/13/3873352/mit-announces-internal-investigation-into-its-role-in-aaron-swartz">complicit</a> in the events that led up to his death.</p>
<p>I thought about Aaron Swartz often this year; his death weighed upon me not simply because of friends and colleagues <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40845525507/a-time-for-silence">who knew and</a> <a href="http://www.quinnnorton.com/said/?p=644">loved him well</a>. With all the talk I have heard this year about an ed-tech &ldquo;revolution,&rdquo; oh how few of those folks know what it means to live under the scrutiny, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/life-inside-the-aaron-swartz-investigation/273654/">the investigation</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/09/chelsea-manning-not-a-pacifist">the prosecution</a>, <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/326315-former-nsa-chief-jokes-about-putting-snowden-on-kill-list">the violence</a> of those in power.</p>
<p>Aaron Swartz&rsquo;s politics of &ldquo;open&rdquo; were <em>a politics</em>. &ldquo;Open&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t simply an adjective plugged into a press release, attached to a startup pitch, embedded in a tech blog headline. Aaron Swartz&rsquo;s politics of &ldquo;open&rdquo; were enmeshed with a challenge to intellectual property law; they offered a challenge to the economics of restricted access to scholarship; they were intertwined with the technologies of the open Web &ndash; and those technologies, let&rsquo;s not forget, <em>are</em> political as well.</p>
<p>If, as I suggested in my previous <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/12/11/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-data-privacy/">&ldquo;Top Ed-Tech Trends&rdquo; article on data and privacy</a>, that <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/snowden-for-person-of-the-year-and-coverage-of-a-story-that-just-wont-quit/?smid=tw-share">revelations (thanks to Edward Snowden)</a> of the sweeping NSA surveillance programs are the most important story of 2013, then I&rsquo;d add too that that story cannot be fully separated from Aaron Swartz&rsquo;s &ndash; the control of information and data, the use of technology to &ldquo;liberate&rdquo; information, the persecution/prosecution of these &ldquo;hackers,&rdquo; systems of power (that liberal IP licensing doesn't necessarily unseat),&nbsp;the battle for &ldquo;open.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Battle for Open</h2>
<p><a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/12/the-battle-for-open.html">Open University&rsquo;s Martin Weller recently argued</a> in an essay called &ldquo;<a href="http://jime.open.ac.uk/jime/article/view/2013-15">The Battle for Open</a>&rdquo; that &ldquo;Openness has been victorious in many ways,&rdquo; but Weller cautioned that &ldquo;at this point of victory the real struggle begins.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you look at openness in research, teaching, publication scholarship, then it&rsquo;s hard to argue that openness hasn&rsquo;t been successful over the last few years in establishing itself as a core approach in higher education. It isn&rsquo;t something just a few oddballs bang on about now, it has moved to the centre of discourse (and, more importantly, funding).&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it should. We aren&rsquo;t seeing David Wiley leading triumphant processions down Wall Street. The MOOC invasion and backlash is the most visible part of all this, but I think that is just representative of a wider story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This battle involves the ongoing struggle to define &ldquo;what is open.&rdquo; It involves the narratives that dominate education &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="http://followersoftheapocalyp.se/education_is_broken/">education is broken</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/05/24/disruptive-innovation/">disruption is inevitable</a>,&rdquo; for example &ndash; and the &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; that &ldquo;open&rdquo; purports to offer. It involves a response to the growth of <a href="http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/corporate-open-source">corporate ecosystems</a> and <a href="http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/commercial-enclosure">commercial enclosures</a>, built with open source technologies and open data initiatives. And all of this, I would argue, must involve politics for which we shouldn't let "open" be an easy substitute.</p>
