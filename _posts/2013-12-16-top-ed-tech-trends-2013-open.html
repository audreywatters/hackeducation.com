<p><a title="Boheken Heart, Bologna by flatworldsedge, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flatworldsedge/5208973775/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5084/5208973775_f0b6039b21.jpg" alt="Boheken Heart, Bologna" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>As with the trend of &ldquo;data,&rdquo; &ldquo;open&rdquo; is something I&rsquo;ve touched upon in each of my annual year-end reviews (in <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/15/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2011-open">2011</a> and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/07/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-the-battle-to-open-textbooks">2012</a>. Again, I recommend reading those posts to gain a sense of past, present, and future).</p>
<p>In some ways the two &ndash;&ldquo;data&rdquo; and &ldquo;open&rdquo; &ndash; represent opposite directions in ed-tech: the former towards a consolidation of power; the latter towards its distribution. The former towards an extraction of value from the learning community, from the public; the latter towards the cultivation of a commons.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a terrible over-simplication, in part because both &ldquo;open&rdquo; and &ldquo;data&rdquo; have become so deeply intertwined in what Evgeny Morozov in <em>To Save Everything Click Here</em> calls &ldquo;technological solutionism&rdquo; &ndash; this notion that technology can provide us with simple answers (in this case, with more data or more openness) to complicated questions we can&rsquo;t fully articulate or haven&rsquo;t fully explored. (My review of his book as it pertains to ed-tech is <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/03/26/ed-tech-solutionism-morozov">here</a>.)</p>
<p>In addition to the publication of his book this year, Morozov also penned a particularly brutal critique of Tim O&rsquo;Reilly, coiner of the term &ldquo;Web 2.0,&rdquo; champion of open source and open government, and, in Morozov&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler">Meme Hustler</a>.&rdquo; Morozov&rsquo;s article &ndash; both very long and very harsh &ndash; raises important questions about the politics of software, the rhetoric of openness, and an embrace of &ldquo;algorithmic regulation.&rdquo; What do the forces of &ldquo;big data&rdquo; and &ldquo;openness&rdquo; have in common? What are the politics of &ldquo;open,&rdquo; or is &ldquo;open&rdquo; often simply a substitute for politics?</p>
