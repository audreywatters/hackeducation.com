There&rsquo;s the notion, for example, that it&rsquo;s much easier&nbsp;<a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/11/plagiarism-tactics-differ-between-high-school-and-college-students/">to plagiarize</a>&nbsp;now thanks to the ability to copy and paste information from the Web into a term paper.</p>

The site offers the answers to homework questions in most major high school level math textbooks, and depending on how much you use it, there&rsquo;s a fee. Students can pay for answers. Answers to&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the questions, not just the odd ones. And answers with explanations and &ldquo;proofs.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s not as straightforward a transaction as it looks.</p>
