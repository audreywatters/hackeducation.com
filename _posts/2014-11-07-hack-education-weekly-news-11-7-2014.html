<h3>US Midterm Elections</h3>
<br />
<p>Americans voted on Tuesday &mdash; or, a small percentage of them did. According to early figures, about <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/11/05/361820838/midterm-elections-may-have-had-record-low-turnout">36.6%</a> of the eligible population cast their ballot in this year&rsquo;s <strong>midterm elections</strong>, the lowest turnout since 1942 (which was, it&rsquo;s worth noting, in the middle of the Second World War).</p>
<p>As such, it&rsquo;s a little hard to trumpet the results as a mandate. Nevertheless, the results, as they were, were a major win for the <strong>Republican party</strong>, which now takes control of the US Senate and maintains control of the House of Representatives. The Republicans also won 31 governorships. And they now <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/11/6/7164287/midterm-elections-2014-state-legislatures-governors-party-control">control</a> &ldquo;at least 66 of 99 state legislative chambers nationwide.&rdquo; This could have a major impact on education policy, particularly as those state legislatures dictate public education funding. Yahoo. The Republicans are also probably going to fuck with any semblance of progressive environmental policies we have on the books too, so ya know. Maybe climate change can take us all out before the government has a chance to pass too much legislation. Who knows.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s how <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/1114/morningeducation15976.html">Politico</a> summarized the results of Tuesday's voting as they pertain to education:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a crushing night for <strong>teachers unions</strong> and their allies. After pumping well over $60 million into races across the country, the unions could point to just two bright spots: They succeeded in ousting Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett. Incumbent state Superintendent Tom Torlakson came out on top in California. Otherwise, it was a bloodbath. And not just because of the near-total Republican sweep of the mostly hotly contested Senate seats and gubernatorial races. Ardent foes of the Common Core were poised to take over as schools chiefs in Arizona and in Georgia, defeating more moderate candidates that the unions had fought hard to elect. A ballot measure to raise money for public schools by hiking certain corporate taxes went down to a huge defeat in Nevada. A proposal to reduce class sizes (and hire new educators) was trailing in Washington state, despite a huge lead in pre-election polling. And the unions&rsquo; preferred measure for expanding access to pre-K &mdash; and raising wages for child-care workers &mdash; failed in Seattle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong> Senator Lamar Alexander (formerly the Secretary of Education under President Bush) will now likely lead the Senate&rsquo;s education committee. <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/149807/">The Chronicle of Higher Education profiles</a> him.</p>

<p>Voters in <strong>New York</strong> <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/11/ed-tech_bond_newyork.html">approved</a> a $2 billion ed-tech bond measure. Maybe they can talk to LAUSD about how to spend billions on iPads.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2014/11/03/the-most-expensive-political-contest-in-california-is-for-an-office-nobodys-heard-of/">most expensive political contest</a> in <strong>California</strong> was for the state superintendent of public instruction. The race was between two Democrats &ndash; incumbent Tom Torlakson, who was supported by teachers unions and challenger Marshall Tuck, a former charter school executive. As noted above, Torlakson won (by 4% points).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/1114/morningeducation16007.html">86%</a> of the candidates backed by <strong>Michelle Rhee</strong>&rsquo;s group Students First won their respective races.</p>

<h3>Meanwhile on Campus</h3>
<br />
<p><strong>Harvard University</strong> has been spying on folks again. Last year it was caught searching faculty emails. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/us/secret-cameras-rekindle-privacy-debate-at-harvard.html">This week</a>, &ldquo;the university acknowledged that as part of a study on attendance at lectures, it had used hidden cameras to photograph classes without telling the professors or the students.&rdquo; <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/149879/">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a> write-up of the revelation contains this wonderful sentence: &ldquo;But putting aside the question of whether the methodology was ethical, what did the researchers learn about classroom-attendance patterns from their study, and what were the motives behind the experiment?&rdquo; Yes. Let&rsquo;s put aside the ethics of surveillance and data collection in education. Carry on!</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Texas System</strong> <a href="http://www.utsystem.edu/news/2014/11/03/university-texas-system-makes-bold-move-competency-based-education">plans</a> to launch a <strong>competency-based</strong> degree program.</p>

<p><strong>LAUSD</strong> is <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/misis-system-not-feasible-unless-modified-says-analyst-for-lausd/">still struggling</a> with its new student information system.
