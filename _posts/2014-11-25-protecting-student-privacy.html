<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This post first appeared on <a href="http://modernlearners.com/protecting-student-privacy-through-more-transparency/">Educating Modern Learners</a></em></p>
<p>As  schools in the Northern Hemisphere are poised to kick off the new  school year, they&rsquo;re likely sending home a flurry of permission slips  for parents and guardians to sign. Permissions for the student  directory, permissions for field trips, permissions for sports and other  after school activities, a photo release form, and increasingly  perhaps, permissions (especially if the student is under 13 in the US)  for Internet and technology usage.</p>
<p>The latter has become <a href="https://modernlearners.com/student-data-vs-student-privacy/">a particularly contentious issue</a> in the last year or so, with some parents growing concerned about the  amount of data that schools are collecting via the various ed-tech tools  that students might use. Add to that too, the broad range of  technologies being used by schools &mdash; systems that manage student  reporting, special school functions, transportation and food services,  and of course classroom usage. &ldquo;Student data&rdquo; now exists across many  systems, in many software applications.</p>
<p>Parents concerns about their children's data and privacy are not entirely unwarranted. According to a <a href="http://law.fordham.edu/center-on-law-and-information-policy/30198.htm">study</a> conducted last year by Fordham University on schools, data, and privacy,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Cloud  services are poorly understood, non-transparent, and weakly governed:  only 25% of districts inform parents of their use of cloud services, 20%  of districts fail to have policies governing the use of online  services, and a sizeable plurality of districts have rampant gaps in  their contract documentation, including missing privacy policies.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  study also found that less than 10% of school districts negotiate  contracts with technology vendors to prevent student data being shared  or sold.</p>
<p>All this is complicated now that new education  technologies are being marketed directly to teachers, sometimes  bypassing any district procurement process. That means there often isn&rsquo;t  an opportunity for schools to negotiate what happens to student data.  You click on &ldquo;I agree&rdquo; to the Terms of Service, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>But  there are steps that schools can take in order to do a better job  protecting student privacy, and a strong first step is to improve the  transparency over what data is being collected and why.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t  simply a matter of following laws like FERPA (the Family Educational  Rights and Privacy Act), COPPA (the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection  Act) or PPRA (the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment) &mdash; although in  the US at least, those do apply. These simply outline what schools <em>must </em>do; but there is more they <em>could</em> do (and that involves, for starters, involving students and not just grown-ups in the conversation).</p>
<h2>What Should Schools Tell Parents and Students About Data?</h2>
<p>Some  questions school leaders must consider, and some suggestions for  improving transparency around student privacy and student data:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What data are you collecting about students?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Consider  developing a &ldquo;data inventory&rdquo; that lists all the information you  collect about students. (If nothing else, it will be a helpful exercise  for schools to see the scope of what is being collected, let alone if  this data is kept secure and/or private.)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why are you collecting this data?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For mandated reporting? To improve instruction? To administer services?</p>
<p>And consider: you can&rsquo;t come up with a good reason <em>why </em>you&rsquo;re collecting the data, perhaps ask if you <em>should </em>be.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How is the data protected?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Where is the data stored? Locally? In the cloud? (And if it&rsquo;s the latter, where are those servers located?)</p>
<p>What  are the security practices and policies of your IT department? Of  cloud-based services? What are your school&rsquo;s policies governing access  to student data?</p>
<p>Do researchers have access to student data? How is that disclosed?</p>
<p>What  training do school teachers and staff have on data policies and  protection? What training do students receive on data and privacy?  (These questions are increasingly part of new digital literacies, it  seems, that schools must help to facilitate.)</p>
<p>How long do you store data?</p>
<p>How  is PII (personally identifiable information) protected? Do you  de-identify data? When you display data in aggregate (say, to talk about  student demographics) how do you make sure that the identity of  students from &ldquo;small cells&rdquo; (or small groups) is not accidentally  disclosed?</p>
<p>What is the procedure for handling a data breach?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What data is shared? With whom? Why?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Schools  contract with a wide range of third-party vendors for and products and  services. Consider posting those contracts online. (The Fordham study on  student privacy expressed particular concern that many schools were not  able to provide signed contracts for the technologies they were using.  Without these, the legal responsibilities of schools and vendors are  unclear.)</p>
<p>Provide  parents with a list of the educational software that teachers use in  the classroom. Provide links to those apps' Terms of Service and Privacy  Policies.</p>
<p>Put all this&nbsp;&mdash; contracts, lists of tools, Terms of  Service&nbsp;&mdash; in one place on the school or district website. Make it is  easy to locate. Use plain language &mdash; that is, avoid legal or technical  jargon &mdash; to talk about data and privacy policies. (A good example of a  site that helps clarify the legalese here is <a href="http://tosdr.org">Terms of Service; Didn&rsquo;t Read</a>).  Make sure the website is kept up-to-date throughout the school year  particularly if and when teachers try new tools and if and when vendors  change their terms.</p>
<p>Give parents a way to contact the school or district if they have questions or concerns.</p>
<p>Solicit  feedback from the school community &mdash; that is, parents, administrators,  staff, teachers, and students &mdash; about how best to handle data and  privacy. Again, while there are certain legal requirements as to how  schools handle student data, those should be seen as the minimum, not  the maximum obligation for schools to fulfill.</p>
<h2>Next Steps for Schools</h2>
<p>Schools  need not &mdash; and probably should not &mdash; be passive parties when it comes  to data protection and the technologies they're adopting. While vendors  typically do draw up the contracts for their products, schools must  ensure that these are compliant with various privacy statutes,  certainly. But they can advocate for more, and push vendors to take  further steps to protect student privacy. They can also step up and do a  better job in communicating with parents and students about data  collection and usage.</p>
