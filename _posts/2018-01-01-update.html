<p>I&#8217;ve made some changes to this site, most obviously updating the header image. That&#8217;s <a href="http://bryanmmathers.com/">thanks to Bryan Mathers</a>, of course, who continues to capture what I am thinking so perfectly in his drawings. (<a href="http://pigeons.hackeducation.com/">Why a pigeon</a>?)</p>

<p>Those who look closely will also note that I have also changed how the work here is licensed. No longer is there a Creative Commons license on Hack Education material or on my personal blog. This really doesn&#8217;t change much, I promise. It does not change what you can read on my sites. Hack Education will remain free, without advertising or analytics or paywalls of any sort. Mostly <em>it means you have to ask my permission</em> before republishing my work. If you do wish to reprint or reuse my writing, <a href="mailto:mail@audreywatters.com">please contact me directly</a>.</p>

<p>Like all decisions I make about my websites, I am quite certain that this will enrage a handful of people who feel as though it is my duty to make myself &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;accessible&#8221; on <em>their</em> terms, but not on mine. Instead of making demands and making presumptions about a writer (any writer, but particularly this woman), <em>ask permission</em>.</p>
