<p><em>Part 4 of my research into the availability and accessibility of open educational resources. (See: parts <a href="/2012/08/15/oer-use-re-use-remix/">1</a>, <a href="/2012/08/22/oer-repositories/">2</a>, and <a href="/2012/08/23/oer-types-by-the-number/">3</a>.)</em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="/2012/08/23/oer-types-by-the-number/">no shortage</a> of openly-licensed educational content online. Trickier, however, is finding the <em>right</em> resource &mdash; whether you&rsquo;re a teacher or learner. And in some way, the challenges of that search &mdash; whether real or perceived &mdash; stand in the way of more widespread adoption of OER.</p>
<p>Or so I gather from conversations I have with educators and organizations.</p>
<p>Below is a survey I&rsquo;ve created that asks some questions in the hopes of getting to the heart of this question: why or why not do you use OER? There are other questions too, particularly geared towards finding out how OER are used and if they&rsquo;re remixed (and again, why or why not).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking these questions of teachers <em>and</em> learners, because I think the usage by both groups is worth tracking.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, I plan to create another survey and write another blog post too about teachers and learners&rsquo; understanding of copyright and Creative Commons licensing and how they opt to license their own work &mdash; but that&rsquo;s for another day.)</p>
<p>None of these surveys are terribly scientific, of course; none will be terribly conclusive. I am more interested in qualitative than quantitative responses &mdash; but the more who answer the merrier. (So thanks in advance!)</p>
