<p>Over the weekend, The New York Times published the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/technology/a-classroom-software-boom-but-mixed-results-despite-the-hype.html">second story</a> in its series on Grading the Digital School. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/technology/technology-in-schools-faces-questions-on-value.html?ref=technology">first story</a> in the series questioned the massive expenditures schools make on education technology, pointing to stagnant test scores as an indication that these investments might not be worth it. Last weekend's story extends that skeptical eye to the outcomes from educational software, again questioning whether using these tools in the classroom makes much of a difference in terms of student achievement.</p>
