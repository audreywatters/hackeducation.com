<h2>Tinkering with the Web</h2>
<p>One of the very first "a-ha" moments I had when I was trying to teach myself HTML was that I could right-click and "view source."  Perhaps it sounds silly and obvious to say that now, but at the time, I felt as though I had pulled back the curtain on the Great and Mighty Wizard of Oz.  "So <em>that's</em> how they built it," I realized, scanning through what was at the time, I admit, mostly indecipherable code.  But what I saw was enough for me to copy and paste and tweak that I started to get a sense of what was actually going on on a website.</p>
<p>Years later, I discovered <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>, a tool to help me inspect the HTML on a given page and, even better, help me debug stuff on my own.</p>
<h2>Hackasaurus</h2>
<p><a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>'s <a href="http://hackasaurus.org/">Hackasaurus</a> taps into that same sort of discovery, that same act of peeling back the layers behind a Web page.  But it does so with a fair friendlier interface than either "view source" or Firebug can provide.</p>
<p>Hackasaurus offers "X-Ray Goggles" for the Web through a simple browser add-on. &nbsp;With those x-ray goggles, users can -- as the name suggests -- peer beneath the surface to see what the Web is made of. &nbsp;The goggles can be activated on any Web page, enabling a view of its building blocks. &nbsp;By mousing over the various elements of a Web page, users are able to see the code, and by clicking they can actually manipulate it -- replacing images, for example, or adjusting fonts or alignment.</p>
<p>These remixes can also be published (to <a href="http://remixes.hackasaurus.org/en-US/">remixes.hackasaurus.org</a>) and shared with others.</p>

<p>Hackasaurus demonstrates that the Web is tinker-able -- that's profoundly important for folks to realize. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In honor of the Valentines Day, the Hackasaurus team has created several "<a href="http://lovebomb.me/">Love Bombs</a>" using the tool.  With it, you can hack your own message of love, such as the one that Atul Varna has written to Tim Berners-Lee. <em>Awwww</em>.</p>

<p><em>Disclosure:  I am currently working on a research project for Mozilla regarding helping people become web-builders, asking whether there's a need for a "Scratch for HTML 5."  I haven't spoken to members of the Hackasaurus team yet, but it's at the very top of my To Do list.</em></p>

<p><em>Questions I want to ask them:  How do we get from deconstruction and remixing to construction and building?  Is there a learning path (or even a difference)?</em></p>
