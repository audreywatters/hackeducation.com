<p>&#8220;<strong>Who has the most expensive higher education system for students?</strong>&#8221; <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2016/05/19/who-has-the-most-expensive-higher-education-system-for-students/">asks Tony Bates</a>, as he examines tuition and debt in England. An excerpt from his blog post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current Conservative government seems to be ideologically driven towards the privatisation of public education in England. Government funding for universities has been replaced by tuition fees, and the government wants to introduce market competition between schools and also between universities in the belief that this will drive up &#8220;quality.&#8221; Nevertheless there is no empirical evidence in the UK that shows that students from academies (which are replacing local government-run schools) or institutional competition through tuition pricing in universities is leading to better learning outcomes.</p>
<br />
<p>The Conservatives seem to have a completely wrong concept of education, based on set curricula, repeated testing of content, highly selective &#8220;weeding out&#8221; of students who do not fit this paradigm, and governance by unelected trusts or corporations, a model of education that is clearly influenced by the British public boarding school system from which most of the Conservative government ministers have graduated. The current English education system is in a time warp that seems to belong more to the 1920s than the 2020s.</p>
