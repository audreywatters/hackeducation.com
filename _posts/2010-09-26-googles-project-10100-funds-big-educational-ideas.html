<p>Google announced on Friday the recipients of its <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/project-10100.html">Project 10^100</a> funding:  5 organizations that Google believes have the ability to really change the world, by impacting the lives of as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Three of the five recipients address the area of education directly, which I think is a testament to the power of the Internet to really transform how we think about teaching and learning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Khan Academy</em></strong> <strong>Idea</strong>: Make educational content available online for free <strong>Project funded</strong>: The <a href="http://khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> is a non-profit educational organization with a library of over 1600 instructional videos, made by founder Sal Khan. Google are donating $2 million to support the creation of more course material and to help translate these videos into other languages.  I don't think it's a stretch to say that when I close my eyes to imagine "<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/08/07/what-makes-a-revolutionary-ed-tech-startup/">revolutionary ed-tech</a>," I don't think of think of Khan Academy.  (Investor <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/09/sal-kahns-academy.html">Fred Wilson</a> has a blog post about Khan Academy today that points to some of the visitor stats from Khan Academy, noting its global reach.)</p>
<p><strong><em>FIRST</em></strong> <strong>Idea</strong>: Enhance science and engineering education <strong>Project funded</strong>: <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">FIRST</a> is a non-profit organization that promotes science and math education around the world through team robotics-building competitions.  Google is giving FIRST providing $3 million to help expand the program.</p>
<p><strong><em>AIMS</em></strong> <strong>Idea</strong>: Provide quality education to students in Africa <strong>Project funded</strong>: The <a href="http://www.aims.ac.za/">African Institute for Mathematical Sciences</a> (AIMS) is a center for math and science education and research in Cape Town, South Africa. AIMS offers a one-year skill-building post-undergrad program for recent science graduates. Google's $2 million will fund the opening of additional AIMS centers to promote graduate level math and science study in Africa.</p>
