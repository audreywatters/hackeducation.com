<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 4 of my <a href="http://2013trends.hackeducation.com">Top 10 Ed-Tech Trends of 2013</a> series</em></p>

<p>Barely a week has gone by this year without some MOOC-related news. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/03/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-moocs">Much like last year</a>, massive open online courses have dominated ed-tech conversations.</p>
<p>But if 2012 was, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html">as The New York Times decreed</a>, the year of the MOOC, 2013 might be described as the year of the anti-MOOC as we slid down that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">Gartner Hype Cycle</a> from the &ldquo;Peak of Inflated Expectations&rdquo; and into the &ldquo;Trough of Disillusionment.&rdquo; For what it&rsquo;s worth, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/2559615">Gartner pegged MOOCs</a> at the peak back in July, while the Horizon Report says they&rsquo;re still <a href="http://www.nmc.org/news/horizon-report-2013-higher-ed-edition-here">on the horizon</a>. Nevertheless the head of edX appeared on the <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/428046/july-24-2013/anant-agarwal">Colbert Report</a> this year, and the word &ldquo;<a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/MOOC?q=MOOC">MOOC</a>&rdquo; entered the Oxford Online Dictionary &ndash; so whether you think those are indications of peak or trough or both or neither, it seems the idea of free online university education has hit the mainstream.</p>

<h3>MOOCs: An Abbreviated History</h3>
<br />
<p>To recap: in 2008, Dave Cormier coins the term &ldquo;MOOC&rdquo; to describe George Siemens&rsquo; and Stephen Downes&rsquo; course &ldquo;Connectivism and Connective Knowledge.&rdquo; In the Fall of 2011, Stanford offers open enrollment in online versions of three engineering classes: Artificial Intelligence (taught by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig), Machine Learning (taught by Andrew Ng), and Databases (taught by Jennifer Widom). In December 2011, MIT unveil MITx. In January 2012, Thrun announces he&rsquo;s leaving Stanford to launch Udacity. In April 2012, Ng, along with Stanford colleague Daphne Koller, launch Coursera. In May 2012, Harvard and MIT team up for edX. In December 2012, 12 British universities partner to launch their MOOC platform, FutureLearn. And in 2013&hellip;</p>
