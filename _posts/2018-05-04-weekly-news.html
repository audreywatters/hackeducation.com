<blockquote>
<p>One described an issue raised by others at some Noble campuses, regarding girls not having time to use the bathroom when they get their menstrual periods.</p>
<br />
<p>&#8220;We have (bathroom) escorts, and they rarely come so we end up walking out (of class) and that gets us in trouble,&#8221; she texted. “But who wants to walk around knowing there’s blood on them? It can still stain the seats. They just need to be more understanding.&quot;</p>
<br />
<p>At certain campuses, teachers said administrators offer an accommodation: They allow girls to tie a Noble sweater around their waist, to hide the blood stains. The administrator then sends an email to staff announcing the name of the girl who has permission to wear her sweater tied around her waist, so that she doesn&#8217;t receive demerits for violating dress code.</p>
