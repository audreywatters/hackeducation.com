<p>Big news from <a href="http://mit.edu">MIT</a> today with its announcement of MITx, an online learning platform that will, for a "modest fee," offer non-enrolled students a certificate for successful course completion.  (With that, kudos to Dave Cormier for having one of his <a href="http://davecormier.com/edblog/2011/12/19/top-ten-black-swans/">2012 ed-tech predictions</a> already come true!)</p>
<p>You can read my thoughts (and my long list of questions) about the new initiative over on <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/mitx-next-chapter-university-credentialing">Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
