<p><a href="http://learnboost.com">LearnBoost</a> launched its free gradebook and lesson plan software today.  See my <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/learnboost_aces_the_gradebook.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> coverage.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.xplana.com">Xplana</a>, an online social learning platform, launched yesterday.</p>
<p>Interestingly, both of these companies have been on my radar for quite some time prior to their launch due their blogs.  Granted, I may be partial to quality blogs as a writer, and as someone who scours RSS feeds daily to find news.  But I think smart blogging can demonstrate you have a real grasp on your market, and it helps establish your voice within your industry.  For a startup to be able to launch with that "cred" already in place is great.</p>
