<p>I woke up yesterday to the news that <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> had raised <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/06/19/codecademy-closes-10-million-round/">$10 million</a>. I decided to skip writing another <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/10/28/codecademy-and-the-future-of-not-learning-to-code/">screed</a>, even though I think many of my original complaints about the site are still valid. Considering how I came a little unhinged at the $2.5 million that the startup raised last fall, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re all deeply disappointed that I didn&rsquo;t hammer out four times as much of a rage-fest with four times as much as an investment injection. This is, after all a startup that&rsquo;s still being praised and funded as the future of learning.</p>
<p>(It&rsquo;s not.)</p>
<p>Instead I want to tell a different story about a different organization that&rsquo;s got a better story and a better approach with better results. There are no <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/technology/lawsuit-against-kleiner-perkins-is-shaking-silicon-valley.html">famed Silicon Valley venture capitalists</a> on board with this one, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson">no knights</a>. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/10/28/codenow-champion-non-profit">The White House is a fan</a> though, so there&rsquo;s that&hellip;</p>
<p>That organization is <a href="http://codenow.org/">CodeNow</a>, a DC-based non-profit that teaches high-school age kids how to program. (I have covered the organization several times in the past: <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/11/02/codenow-teaching-programming-narrowing-the-digital-divide/">once</a> as an introduction to the non-profit and <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/02/25/lowering-the-barriers-to-entry-code-now-ryan-seashore/">once</a> to interview founder Ryan Seashore for the research I undertook for Mozilla on how to support Web literacies.)</p>

<p>There are so many things about CodeNow that I really like: its DC location means it&rsquo;s working with youth of color, and about 40% of the students who&rsquo;ve participated in its programs have been girls &ndash; both of these are absolutely crucial since the tech industry and CS field remains largely white and male. And rather than building a teach-yourself-through-a-Web-based tool and arguing that that&rsquo;s sufficient or &ldquo;easy&rdquo; or &ldquo;the best way,&rdquo; CodeNow takes a multi-pronged approach: There are free training sessions and bootcamps where students are introduced to programming through things like Lego Mindstorms and <a href="http://hackety.com/">Hackety Hack</a>. (The current developer on the HacketyHack project, Steve Klabnik, is one of the CodeNow instructors.) There&rsquo;s ongoing access to <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> where students can hone their Web development and design skills. There are connection to mentors and internship opportunities via meet-ups. Attendees all receive netbooks &ndash; for many participants this is their first computer. And finally, CodeNow is project-based: students learn how to build a website or a game or a robot &ndash; a programming project that matters to them.</p>

<p>Seashore emailed me the other day to boast about the project of one of his students: Wilfried Hounyo, who&rsquo;ll be going into 11th grade in the fall. Wilfried had no real programming experience before attending a CodeNow bootcamp this winter, but took to it &ldquo;like a fish to water.&rdquo; By the end of the session he had created business cards for himself that read &ldquo;future engineer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since then he, along with two friends from high school &ndash; Golden Rockefeller and Endre Osbourne &ndash; designed and built &ldquo;Electrobob,&rdquo; a game that teaches some of the fundamentals of electrons. Wilfried did all the coding The team entered the <a href="http://www.theesa.com/newsroom/release_detail.asp?releaseID=173">Entertainment Software Association&rsquo;s STEM Video Game challenge</a>. And they achieved co-winner honors in the Playable Game &ndash; Team category. That is awesome.</p>
<p>Wilfried is &ldquo;the reason why we do this,&rdquo; says Seashore, who admits that not every student walks away from a CodeNow bootcamp wanting to become a software engineer. But that&rsquo;s not the point. They do walk away having had an introduction to code and to the opportunities that knowing code can bring. &nbsp;And they walk away with a netbook. &nbsp;CodeNow's given out 41 so far.</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="https://twitter.com/ibogost/status/215283010227019776">Georgia Tech professor Ian Bogost tweeted</a>, &ldquo;Reminder: when startups raise money to &lsquo;democratize&rsquo; something, they&rsquo;re really &lsquo;commercializing&rsquo; it.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure if he was thinking about &ldquo;democratizing learning to code&rdquo; and Codecademy, but after talking to Seashore earlier in the day and thinking about the comparisons between CodeNow and Codecademy, that&rsquo;s certainly where my mind went.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley pays a lot of lipservice to this &ndash; the notion that &ldquo;everyone should learn to code.&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t think they really mean &ldquo;everyone.&rdquo; Or at least, they&rsquo;re not interested in lowering the barriers to entry for &ldquo;everyone.&rdquo; $10 million for Codecademy. Meanwhile CodeNow is largely bootstrapped.</p>
<p>CodeNow is currently raising money via an <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/CodeNow">IndieGoGo campaign</a>. Seashore says that the non-profit needs more money in order to afford some of the expenses for its summer bootcamp. The crowdfunding campaign means that the bootcamp can go forward, even if grant-making institutions don&rsquo;t come through with the money in time.</p>
