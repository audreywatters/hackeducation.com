<p>Again this year, I'm using <a href="http://storify.com">Storify</a> to gather notes and tweets and whatnot from the events I attend. Today's event: "Rebooting CA Higher Education," an event sponsored by the <a href="http://20mm.org/">Twenty Million Minds Foundation</a> on the UCLA Campus. There was a livestream of the event, but the audio and video were spotty (oh, the irony). I have a lot more to say about this event -- thoughts about what was said and unsaid, who was there and who was absent. So stay tuned...</p>
