<p>Every week,&nbsp;<a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a>&nbsp;and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week. &nbsp;This week, we were actually face-to-face for the recording as we were both in attendance at the <a href="/admin/Blog/dml2012.dmlcentral.net">DML conference</a>&nbsp;in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Our conversation involved wikis, Late Nite Labs, Gates Foundation's investment patterns, my lack of enthusiasm for Seth Godin's writings, and more.&nbsp;</p>
