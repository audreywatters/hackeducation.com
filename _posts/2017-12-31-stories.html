<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say these are <em>all</em> the stories about education technology we were told this year. But these are the ones I decided to analyze:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>In addition to these eleven (damn) articles, I wrote a bunch of supplemental pieces, mostly trying to fill in some of the gaps in the storytelling:</p>

<p>I also wrote about the investors and corporations funding each of these powerful storylines (or at least, funding the new ed-tech companies associated with them):</p>

<p>This was the eighth time undertaking this year-end project, and it was, by far, the most difficult one yet. In part, 2017 was just a very bad year. A bad year for the politics of education. A bad year for the politics of technology. A busy year, full of bad education technology. There were many ed-tech storylines to follow, almost all of them dystopian. In part too, this project is just a lot of work, as there&#8217;s a ton of writing and as (I hope) there&#8217;s some big thinking as well. </p>

<p>This undertaking would not be possible without the scholarship of many other writers and thinkers. (<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/12/30/credits">So credit where credit is due</a>.) <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">And it certainly would not be possible without the financial and moral support of readers</a>. Thank you everyone who read and shared my work this year. </p>

<p>Except for the haters. Don&#8217;t @ me. </p>
