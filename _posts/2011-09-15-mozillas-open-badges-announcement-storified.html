<p><a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> officially announced its <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Open Badges Project</a> today at an event in Washington DC.  The news conference, where Mozilla's executive director Mark Surman was joined by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and others, occurred at 6am PST, so like most left coasters, I woke up to a Twitter stream discussing the project.</p>
<p>I opted to <a href="http://storify.com/audreywatters/mozillas-open-badges-project">Storify</a> some of the conversation to capture some of the initial reactions and questions people are raising.  I do plan to circle back around and write more later.</p>
