<p>&#8220;Our Education Efforts Are Evolving,&#8221; <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Education/Council-of-Great-City-Schools">says <strong>Bill Gates</strong></a>. He told the Council of the Great City Schools that the <strong>Gates Foundation</strong> would spend some $1.7 billion in U.S. public education in the next five years. Some of the details of this spending:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, although we will no longer invest directly in new initiatives based on <strong>teacher evaluations</strong> and <strong>ratings</strong>, we will continue to gather data on the impact of these systems and encourage the use of these systems to improve instruction at the local level.</p>
<br />
<p>Second, we will focus on <strong>locally-driven solutions</strong> identified by <strong>networks of schools</strong>, and support their efforts to use <strong>data-driven continuous learning</strong> and <strong>evidence-based interventions to improve student achievement</strong>.</p>
<br />
<p>Third, we are increasing our commitment to develop <strong>curricula</strong> and <strong>professional development</strong> aligned to <strong>state standards</strong>.</p>
<br />
<p>Fourth, we will continue to support the development of <strong>high-quality charter schools</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
