<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This post first appeared on <a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-does-and-doesnt-progressive-education-plus-technology-look-like-thoughts-on-altschool/">Educating Modern Learners</a></em></p>
<p>In  his keynote at the 2012 OpenEd conference, Gardner Campbell, an  Associate Professor of English at Virginia Tech, &nbsp;talked about the  &ldquo;Ecologies of Yearning.&rdquo; (Seriously: <a href="http://youtu.be/kIzA4ItynYw">watch the video</a>.)  Campbell offered a powerful and poetic vision about the future of open  learning, but noted too that there are competing visions for that  future, particularly from the business and technology sectors. There are  competing definitions of &ldquo;open&rdquo; as well, and pointing to the way in  which &ldquo;open&rdquo; is used (and arguably misused) by education technology  companies, Campbell&rsquo;s keynote had a refrain, borrowed from &ldquo;The Love  Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&rdquo;:&nbsp; <em>"That is not it at all. That is not what I meant, at all.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;That  is not it at all.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve thought of that line again recently when  reading about a new school that recently opened in San Francisco.  AltSchool, according to headlines in the technology press, seeks to &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/01/meet-altschool-the-startup-that-is-going-to-reinvent-primary-education/">reinvent</a>&rdquo;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/18/former-googlers-altschool-raises-33m-from-founders-fund-and-a16z-to-reimagine-primary-education/">reimagine</a>"&nbsp;primary education. "Silicon Valley startup model meets progressive education,&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/04/the-one-room-schoolhouse-goes-high-tech/">KQED Mindshift describes the startup</a>.</p>
<p>Progressive  education plus progressive technology &mdash; that is, technology in the  service of inquiry, computing in the hands of the learner, the Web and  the world readily available to the student, and the reformulation of  school that could come as a result &mdash; &nbsp;is something we want to explore  here at Educating Modern Learners. But looking at AltSchool, all I hear  is T.S. Eliot:&nbsp;"That is not it at all. That is not what I meant, at  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.altschool.com">AltSchool</a>&nbsp;was  founded in 2013 by Max Ventilla, a former Google executive (his Q&amp;A  company Aardvark was acquired by Google in 2010, but he&rsquo;d worked at the  tech giant previously too). When he departed Google last year, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/03/max-ventilla-leaves-google/">Techcrunch speculated</a>&nbsp;that  his next project would be education-related, based on a tweet from his  wife &mdash; a photograph of a pile of education-related books. Embracing the  Silicon Valley mantra of &ldquo;fail fast and pivot,&rdquo; Ventilla has taken that  reading list and jumped headfirst into education, hiring engineers and  teachers (as well as Richard Ludlow, the founder of the education video  site Academic Earth) and starting a new, for-profit school. (The startup  has started the process of becoming a &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation">B corp</a>,&rdquo;&nbsp;meaning that profit isn&rsquo;t its only goal).</p>
<p>It  hasn&rsquo;t officially opened its doors yet, but AltSchool is running a  pilot program now with 20 students from age 5 to 12. &nbsp;Tuition currently  runs $19,100 per year, but might be lower as the school plans to expand  into multiple locations in the fall.</p>
<p>The students at AltSchool are  not separated by grade; they&rsquo;re in one large room that has various  activity centers and space for solitary and group work. Mindshift writer  Katrina Schwartz, who visited the school, <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/04/the-one-room-schoolhouse-goes-high-tech/">writes</a>&nbsp;that  "There are times in the day when students are working on independent  projects and skills tailored to their skill level, interests, and needs.  'We expose them to a lot of different things and then sit back and  observe, listen to what they say, watch what really excites them, and  then build on that and ask questions that go deeper,&rsquo; [teacher Carolyn]  Wilson said.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>"Personalization" and Playlists</h3>
<br />
<p>There  are elements of AltSchool that draw on progressive education, to be  sure, and the startup says that it&rsquo;s focused on helping students "drive  their own education through their real-world motivations and interests.&rdquo;<br /> But the startup draws on a mishmash of educational theories and  technologies, many of which undercut the claims of AltSchool being  &ldquo;progressive.&rdquo; Although it touts the &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; of the program,  it&rsquo;s worth questioning here (as is often the case when that buzzword is  used in education circles) what that actually means.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.altschool.com/bespoke-education">Ventilla&nbsp;describes</a> the school's &ldquo;Personalized Learning Plan&rdquo; as something "developed  collaboratively with insights from teachers, family, and students. It  prioritizes a set of learning objectives and milestones that are  informed by a standards-based curriculum. It also includes goals for  academic, social, and emotional development. The PLP maps from  AltSchool&rsquo;s global notion of what children should learn and how students  generally learn best, as represented by their Learner Profile."</p>
<p>And again, from the Mindshift description of the school:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another  borrowed idea applied to AltSchool is the School of One model in New  York. Students at AltSchool work from an individual playlist the teacher  puts together that&rsquo;s keyed to his or her interests. The teacher can  keep track of student progress on a dashboard, ensure the tasks have  been completed, and adjust activities depending on how students are  progressing. For example, recently, AltSchool teacher Carolyn Wilson  assigned a video about California&rsquo;s delta to one student, paired with  questions about how water moves through the system.</p>
<br />
<p>"He moved it  to the &lsquo;done&rsquo; column, but it wasn&rsquo;t done, so I told him he was turning  me into a screaming monster,&rdquo; Wilson said. When she checked his work and  saw he hadn&rsquo;t finished, Wilson tagged that assignment with a screaming  monster icon and a note to the student telling him to go back and answer  the questions and complete a reflection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/01/meet-altschool-the-startup-that-is-going-to-reinvent-primary-education/">video filmed during a visit to the school by Techcrunch&rsquo;s Leena Rao</a>&nbsp;also  highlights, the talk about &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; is translated into a  &ldquo;choice&rdquo; about which assignments to do next, a &ldquo;choice&rdquo; of whether to  watch a video or complete a digital worksheet.</p>
<p>Although students  have access to tablets, their usage of technology hardly seems  transformational. The tools are used to deliver content and quizzes and  to track students. Indeed, that seems to be the major point of using  technology: for data collection and analysis to be used by adults  (parents, teachers, school engineers). The tracking doesn&rsquo;t just happen  through the tablets either; the schoolroom is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/18/former-googlers-altschool-raises-33m-from-founders-fund-and-a16z-to-reimagine-primary-education/">equipped with video cameras</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so  that teachers can just press a button to document a moment. Ventilla  says that teachers, parents and students who have been able to actually  watch a breakthrough moment or a moment of breakdown have been able to  help their children learn better. AltSchool has built audio hardware to  better record in noisy settings, and video is uploaded to an online CMS  that both parents and teachers can access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can we reconcile education as surveillance and education as a practice of freedom? I'm not so sure.</p>
<h3>A New Model? An Old Model?</h3>
<br />
<p>AltSchool recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/18/former-googlers-altschool-raises-33m-from-founders-fund-and-a16z-to-reimagine-primary-education/">raised</a> $33 million from&nbsp;Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, First Round  Capital, Harrison Metal, John Doerr, Jonathan Sackler, Learn Capital,  and Omidyar Network.&nbsp;&nbsp;(It had previously raised an <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/altschool">undisclosed amount of seed funding</a>.) As San Francisco Chronicle writer Jill Tucker&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/AltSchool-gets-33-million-in-venture-capital-5327204.php">remarked</a>&nbsp;about  the $33 million, "In the public school world, that much money would be  enough to support a small school district for a year or pay the annual  salaries of more than 400 experienced teachers. Ventilla plans to mostly  spend it on engineers. The AltSchool computer whizzes will design  software and applications that make payroll, hiring, admissions,  facilities services, purchasing and other services &mdash; typically done by a  school district's central office staff &mdash; electronically seamless,  Ventilla said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not trying to make existing schools work better,&rdquo; Ventilla has <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/04/the-one-room-schoolhouse-goes-high-tech/">said in several interviews</a>. &ldquo;We are trying to actually advance a new model of a school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AltSchool raises so many questions about what progressive education plus  technology should or could look like; it certainly shows what I&rsquo;d argue  is the sort of superficial approach to "fixing education" that&rsquo;s all too  common from Silicon Valley technologists. Read a book or two; then  start an education company. How hard can it be?</p>
<p>One of the things  that I find particularly fascinating (and frightening) about this  approach is how little it knows about the history of education,  particularly the history of progressive education, not to mention  theories of constructionism (something you would think would be more  readily adopted by technologists.) In several of its articles about the  startup, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/18/former-googlers-altschool-raises-33m-from-founders-fund-and-a16z-to-reimagine-primary-education/">Techcrunch cites Ventilla</a>&nbsp;saying,  "&ldquo;If a time traveler came back from the early 1900s, and looked at  schools, they would look relatively the same. And there&rsquo;s something  wrong with that, because children and our world have changed.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s as  if John Dewey, his work at the turn of the century not to mention his  legacy in progressive education, never existed.</p>
<p>Of course, much of  the praise and the hype for Ventilla&rsquo;s new startup is a result of  Ventilla himself &mdash; not for this particular idea or this particular  implementation. Ventilla is a well-known person in the technology sector  who has just raised tens of millions of dollars from some of the  best-known investors in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>But as we try to better  articulate better ideas and highlight schools and school leaders who are  actually implementing them, I&rsquo;m still left with that line from &ldquo;The  Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&rdquo;:&nbsp; "That is not it at all. That is not  what I meant, at all.&rdquo;</p>
