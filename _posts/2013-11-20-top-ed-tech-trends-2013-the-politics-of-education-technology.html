<p>I&rsquo;m not going to summarize all the education-related political developments from 2013. Pardon me while I skip over the Department of Education&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/section/infographics/nclbwaivers.html">No Child Left Behind waivers</a>; the impact of <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2013/07/how_did_federal_cuts_impact_k-.html">sequestration</a> and the <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0913/morningeducation11776.html">federal government shutdown</a> of education programs; the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/">Supreme Court&rsquo;s <em>Fisher v Texas</em> decision</a>; <a href="http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/03/28/tennessee-bill-parents-pay-back-welfare-students-fail">(failed) education in Tennessee</a> to tie a family&rsquo;s welfare benefits to children&rsquo;s grades; <a href="http://takingnote.learningmatters.tv/?p=6232">&ldquo;the missing Michelle Rhee&rdquo; memo</a>; <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/04/us-lawmaker-proposes-new-criteri-1.html">Senator Alexander&rsquo;s attempts</a> to let Congress, and not peer review, decide who gets NSF money; court cases against administrators in <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/05/13/608829tnteachertestingfraud_ap.html">Tennessee</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/education/first-trial-ends-in-acquittal-in-school-scandal-in-atlanta.html">Georgia</a> involved in test-cheating scandals; the hiring of former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2013/11/12/protesters-uc-regents-meeting-demand-napolitanos-removal/">head the University of California system</a>; the end of Mayor Bloomberg&rsquo;s tenure in NYC (and as promised by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/de-blasio-aims-to-reverse-education-policies-in-new-york/2013/11/08/5de6d24c-47f2-11e3-b6f8-3782ff6cb769_story.html">newly elected Mayor Bill De Blasio</a>, an end to many of Bloomberg&rsquo;s edu policies); and <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114722/abolish-public-schools-ron-pauls-education-proposal">the publication of Ron Paul&rsquo;s</a> book on education. Might I recommend instead <a href="http://www.politico.com/education/">POLITICO&rsquo;s new education vertical</a>, which launched this year &ndash; particularly its morning email that summarizes all your daily (US) politics-and-education news. (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/11/20/politicos-mike-allen-native-advertising-pioneer/">Or on second thought...</a>)</p>
<p>There are many political developments &ndash; the Common Core State Standards, school districts&rsquo; hardware purchases, MOOCs, NSA spying, accreditation, rising college costs and student loan debt &ndash; that I&rsquo;ll address at more length in subsequent posts. (And I promise, I&rsquo;ll talk more about developments outside the US too.) Perhaps that&rsquo;s the main takeaway from this post: politics permeate ed-tech.</p>
<p>One of the challenges I&rsquo;ve found writing a blog about teaching, learning, and technology is that you can&rsquo;t simply talk about these without talking about business and the politics. And the business and politics of ed-tech bleed into other business practices, technical developments, and policy issues as well. To write about ed-tech without referencing the latter in particular isn&rsquo;t apolitical or neutral or objective. Rather, to do so simply obscures how power operates.</p>
<p>Student homelessness in the US has hit a record high, for example &ndash; there were <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/24/pf/homeless-students/">1.2 million homeless students during the 2011&ndash;2012 school year</a>. That&rsquo;s not an ed-tech story per se, despite the best efforts of those with a <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/05/evgeny-morozov-technology">solutionist</a> bent to make it one &ndash; &ldquo;an app to end homelessness!&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;<a href="https://medium.com/architecting-a-life/fee8f3ee97a0">teach them to code!</a>&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s impossible (or at least deeply, deeply problematic) to ignore growing and vast income disparities, to ignore students&rsquo; lives outside of school and write sunnily about efforts like the &ldquo;flipped classroom&rdquo; or digital textbooks.</p>
<p>And no doubt, if there are &ldquo;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/11/18/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2013-zombie-ideas">zombie ideas</a>&rdquo; in ed-tech as I suggested in the first post in this year-in-review series, it is in no small part due to power and politics. It&rsquo;s such an easy political stance to take, after all: more technology is synonymous with &ldquo;the future&rdquo; &ndash; a better, shinier future.</p>
