<h2>RIP, &ldquo;The Professor&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The actor <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/gilligans-island-star-russell-johnson-dies-kidney-failure/story?id=21561740">Russell Johnson passed away this week</a>. He was best known for playing Roy Hinkley, &ldquo;<strong>The Professor</strong>&rdquo; on <strong><em>Gilligan&rsquo;s Island</em></strong>. (TV Trivia: The Professor was a high school science teacher, not a college prof.)</p>
<h2>Politics</h2>
<p>An appeals court this week struck down the FCC&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong>net neutrality</strong>&rdquo; rules, which prohibit companies from prioritizing some Internet traffic over others and/or charging more to access certain sites. <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/01/14/breaking-court-strikes-down-fccs-net-neutrality-rules/">Lots of hand-wringing</a> about what this means for the future of the open Internet. But hey kids, don&rsquo;t worry! <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/01/14/breaking-court-strikes-down-fccs-net-neutrality-rules/">Khan Academy has already partnered with Comcast</a>, so at least you might not have to pay extra to watch his calculus videos. Yay?</p>
<p>The <strong>White House</strong> held an education &ldquo;<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/01/white_house_education_department_talk_data_entrepreneurship.html">datapalooza</a>&rdquo; this week (which is sorta government-speak for &ldquo;hackathon&rdquo;), showing how education data could be (by entrepreneurs) used to improve college access and affordability.</p>
<p>The <strong>White House </strong>also gathered higher education folks for a <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/15/president-obama-set-convene-rare-meeting-large-group-college-leaders">summit</a> on Thursday to talk about doing more to make college accessible for low-income students and other parts of the President&rsquo;s Higher Education Plan. <strong>First Lady Michelle Obama</strong> has also been enlisted to help make the case, this week talking about her own experiences as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michelle-obama-uses-life-story-to-promote-education-initiative/2014/01/17/bb4f27f6-7eb4-11e3-93c1-0e888170b723_story.html?tid=up_next">a first generation college student</a> at <strong>Princeton</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Apple</strong> has <a href="http://recode.net/2014/01/15/apple-agrees-to-ftc-consent-decree-over-in-app-purchases/">settled</a> with the <strong>FTC</strong> over complaints that it didn&rsquo;t do enough to stop kids from racking up huge bills for their parents by buying in-app items. Apple will refund customers to the tune of $32.5 million.</p>
<p><strong>Congress</strong> has passed the 2014 "omnibus appropriations legislation." Among other things, a win for <strong>open access</strong>&nbsp;to publicly-funded research:&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/41802">it requires that</a> &ldquo;federal agencies with research budgets of at least $100 million per year will be required provide the public with free online access to scholarly articles generated with federal funds.&rdquo; The bill also <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/01/15/appropriations-bill-removes-restrictions-on-nsf-funding-for-political-science/">removes restrictions</a> that prevented the <strong>NSF</strong> from funding political science. There&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/14/budget-negotiators-reach-deal-would-increase-nih-spending-pell-grant-award">more money</a> for the <strong>NIH</strong> and more money for the <strong>Pell Grant</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska</strong> is <a href="http://www.newsminer.com/news/education/alaska-changes-school-testing-consortium/article_05509298-7d77-11e3-9606-001a4bcf6878.html">the latest state</a> to pull out of one of the <strong>CCSS</strong> testing consortia (although the state has <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/in-the-states">not actually adopted</a> the CCSS). Alaska will instead use standardized tests prepared by the University of Kansas.</p>
<p>Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and Representative Jared Polis (D-CO) have <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/195703-in-state-for-dreamers-act-of-2014">introduced</a> the Investing in States To Achieve Tuition Equity (IN-STATE) Act of 2014, which provides incentives for states to offer in-state tuition and need-based aid for <strong>undocumented students</strong>.</p>
<p>Former DC Schools Chancellor <strong>Michelle Rhee</strong> tweeted Wednesday &ldquo;I&rsquo;m around for a little bit, anyone have questions for me? Please use #AskMichelle.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/01/15/the_most_scathing_questions_from_michelle_rhees_doomed_twitter_qa/">And oh, it was glorious</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Michelle Rhee</strong>&rsquo;s education reform group <strong>StudentsFirst</strong> issued another <a href="http://reportcard.studentsfirst.org/">report card</a> this week, assessing how well states have conformed to her ideology. High performing state Massachusetts gets a D+. DC gets a C+. Weird, as the district was at the bottom of the recent <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/qc/2014/state_report_cards.html">Education Week Quality Counts report card</a>.</p>
<p>"&ldquo;If you want a good education, go to private schools. If you can&rsquo;t afford it, tough luck. You can go to the public school.&rdquo; - <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/paul-lepage-maine-governor-crazy-101923.html#.UtlmM2TTlcw"><strong>Maine</strong> Governor Paul LePage</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong> Governor Andrew Cuomo has <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2014/01/8538567/cuomos-school-bond-would-stall-environmental-measure">proposed</a> a new $2 billion education bond measure that would be used to purchase technology for schools. But the bond would &ldquo;effectively kill off any chance of a $5 billion environmental bond that would pay for sewer upgrades, drinking water protection, climate change adaptation, improved air quality and farmland protection.&rdquo; Because iPads.</p>
<h2>LAUSD iPad Saga, Part X</h2>
<p>Early this week, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lausd-surveys-ipad-costs-20140112,0,3048105.story#axzz2qIhElWOg">The LA Times reported</a> that the <strong>Los Angeles School District</strong> was surveying how much other districts had paid for their technology. Because, ya know, I guess they didn&rsquo;t think to do any due diligence before agreeing to the outrageous $768 per <strong>iPad</strong> price-tag.</p>
<p>Whatever the investigation into pricing, it didn&rsquo;t stop the school board from <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/15/los-angeles-school-district-earmarks-115m-for-additiional-ipads">earmarking $115 million</a> to buy more <strong>iPads</strong> to make sure everyone has one in time for &ldquo;standardized testing scheduled for this spring.&rdquo; Priorities.</p>
<h2>Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p>The education startup accelerator program <strong>Imagine K12</strong> has launched its latest batch of companies. <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-01-14-imagine-k12-launches-13-startups">Edsurge has the details</a>.</p>
<p><strong>BetterLesson</strong> <a href="http://cc.betterlesson.com/">launched</a> its Common Core-aligned lesson plan-sharing site. (<a href="http://funnymonkey.com/blog/better-betterlesson">Funnymonkey&rsquo;s Bill Fitzgerald responds</a>.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <strong>Web Literacy Standard</strong> is dead (long live the Web Literacy Map!),&rdquo; <a href="http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2014/01/15/web-literacy-map/">writes Mozilla&rsquo;s Doug Belshaw</a>. In other words, <strong>Mozilla</strong>&rsquo;s Web Literacy Standard initiative &ndash; the non-profit&rsquo;s attempt to identify a framework for web literacy &ndash; is dropping the word &ldquo;standard&rdquo; (because the term is so fraught) and going with &ldquo;map&rdquo; instead.</p>
<p><strong>Schoology</strong> has <a href="https://www.schoology.com/group/25228991/blog/post/85235303">added</a> a step in their teacher verification process (applicable to teachers with students under age 13). The startup says it&rsquo;s a move to help protect student privacy and boasts that it is the only LMS that has TRUSTe COPPA certification.</p>
<p><strong>TED-Ed</strong> has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-01-14-ted-ed-announces-launch-of-ted-ed-clubs">launched</a> TED-Ed Clubs, &ldquo; a school-centric program designed to support students in meeting regularly to discuss and develop TED-like Talks.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Yale</strong> students Peter and Harry Yu built a site that helped students plan their course schedules, integrating information the schedule, course evaluations, and teacher ratings into one site. But as seems to happen frequently when students try to improve these sorts of processes on their campuses, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/16/yale-students-made-a-better-version-of-its-course-catalog-then-yale-shut-it-down/">the school has responded</a> by blocking the Yu&rsquo;s access to the university system.</p>
<p>The trustees of <strong>Cooper Union</strong> have rejected a last-ditch effort that would have prevented the university from charging tuition for the first time in its 150 year history. <a href="http://studentactivism.net/2014/01/11/10004/">More via Angus Johnston</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rocketship Education</strong> <a href="http://www.morganhilltimes.com/news/schools/rocketship-pulls-charter-petition/article_733c1b6a-78a4-11e3-935f-0019bb30f31a.html">will not be expanding</a>&nbsp;its chain of charter schools into the Morgan Hill District, south of San Jose, California. The school board rejected the charter in November, saying over &ldquo;concerns over high student-to-staff ratios [and] the use of uncertified coaches.&rdquo;</p>
