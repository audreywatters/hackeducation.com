<h2>Everything is Horrible</h2>
<p>A <strong>Malaysian Airlines</strong> jet carrying almost 300 people was shot down in <strong>Ukraine</strong> this week. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/07/18/reports-many-aids-researchers-downed-plane">On board</a>: about 100 AIDS researchers, heading to the <strong>20th International AIDS Conference</strong> in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Israeli</strong> troops have started a ground assault into <strong>Gaza</strong>. &ldquo;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/18/us-palestinians-israel-idUSKBN0FI04420140718">291 <strong>Palestinians</strong></a> &ndash; most of them civilians, of whom at least 50 were under the age of 18 &ndash; have been killed since fighting began on July 8.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some 52,000 unaccompanied children from <strong>Central</strong> and <strong>South America</strong> have arrived at the US border since October. The children are<a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/180682/our-refugee-crisis"> seeking asylum here</a>. And the response from many in the US has been <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-immigrants-murrieta-20140701-story.html">so ugly</a>.</p>
<p>Debra Harrell, a 46-year-old African American woman from <strong>South Carolina</strong>, was <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/07/arrested-for-letting-a-9-year-old-play-at-the-park-alone/374436/">arrested</a> for letting her 9-year-old daughter play in a nearby park while she was at work at <strong>McDonalds</strong>.

<p>Silicon Valley VC <strong>Tim Draper</strong> says he&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/silicon-valleys-plan-to-split-california-into-6-states-just-might-work">gathered</a> enough petition signatures for a ballot measure that would split <strong>California</strong> into 6 states. This would create the country&rsquo;s richest state (<strong>Silicon Valley</strong>) and the poorest (Central California).</p>
<p>News broke this spring about an assignment given to middle-schoolers in the <strong>Rialto Unified School District</strong> asking them to argue whether or not the <strong>Holocaust</strong> had occurred. Not surprisingly, many were incensed, but the school district asserted that none of the students actually argued that it hadn&rsquo;t. Not so, according to <a href="http://www.dailybulletin.com/social-affairs/20140711/exclusive-holocaust-denied-by-students-in-rialto-school-assignment">the Daily Bulletin</a>, which obtained copies of students&rsquo; essays.

<p>The estate of <strong>Arthur Conan Doyle</strong> asked the US Supreme Court for a stay after an appeals court ruled earlier this year that Sherlock Holmes should be in the public domain. But the Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan rejected the request without comment. &ldquo;Chalk up another (small) victory for the <strong>public domain</strong>,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140717/14215827921/supreme-court-tells-conan-doyle-estate-to-take-hike-consider-sherlock-holmes-public-domain.shtml">says Techdirt&rsquo;s Mike Masnick</a>.</p>
