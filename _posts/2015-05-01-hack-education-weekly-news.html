<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/obama-pushes-reading-ebook-library-initiatives-30694903">Via the AP</a>: &#8220;Linking reading to technology, the White House marshaled major book publishers to provide more than $250 million in free e-books to low-income students and is seeking commitments from local governments and schools across the country to ensure that every student has a library card.&#8221; The initiative is <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/04/white_house_unveils_new_connected_effort_focused_on_library_access_content.html">part of his ConnectED program</a>, in which ed-tech companies push their products into schools. Hooray for libraries, though. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://dp.la/info/2015/04/30/the-digital-public-library-of-america-partners-with-president-obama-to-provide-children-with-greater-access-to-ebooks/">the DPLA&#8217;s announcement</a>.</p>

<p>US Representatives Jared Polis and Luke Messer have <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/legislators-introduce-student-digital-privacy-bill/">introduced</a> the Student Digital Privacy and Parental Rights Act of 2015, which &#8220;would prohibit operators of websites, apps and other online services for kindergartners through 12th graders from knowingly selling students&#8217; personal information to third parties; from using or disclosing students&#8217; personal information to tailor advertising to them; and from creating personal profiles of students unless it is for a school-related purpose.&#8221; The ed-tech industry is &#8220;wary,&#8221; <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/04/messer-polis_data_privacy_bill_reaction.html">says Education Week</a>. LOL, of course they are.</p>

<p>Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/01/sanders-enters-presidential-campaign-and-touts-free-tuition-plan">entered</a> the US presidential race, pledging &#8220;a &#8216;revolution&#8217; in how higher education is funded. His plan is for the federal government to award $18 billion per year in matching grants to states over and above existing federal aid.Bernie Sanders This would allow public colleges to cut tuition rates by 55 percent, he said.&#8221; </p>

<p>In other presidential candidate news &#8211; good lord, do I have to do this for another whole year?! &#8211; Florida Senator Marco Rubio apparently &#8220;<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-29/marco-rubio-goes-to-bat-for-corinthian-colleges">went to bat</a>&#8221; for Corinthian Colleges last year, asking the Department of Education for leniency with the for-profit college chain. (More on the big news from Corinthian below.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Education Groups Were The Biggest-Spending Lobbyists In New York Last Year,&#8221; <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/education-groups-are-biggest-spending-lobbyists-in-new-york#.twB3xEo23">reports Buzzfeed&#8217;s Molly Hensley-Clancy</a>.

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/snyder-unveils-plan-to-overhaul-detroit-school-system.html">Via The New York Times</a>: &#8220;Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan unveiled a proposal on Thursday to overhaul the failing Detroit public school system by creating two districts - one to manage paying off billions of dollars in debt, the other to oversee the day-to-day operations of the schools.&#8221;</p>

<p>The White House has named <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/05/01/403474819/white-house-honors-2015-teacher-of-the-year-shanna-peeples">the Teacher of the Year</a>: Amarillo, Texas high school teacher Shanna Peeples.</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />

<p>A lawsuit against Western Educational Inc. which runs the for-profit college chain Heritage College can proceed, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/04/30/federal-appeals-court-requires-heritage-college-defend-itself-against-fraud-claims">according to Inside Higher Ed</a>, as &#8220;a federal appeals court Wednesday ordered a for-profit college to defend itself on charges it defrauded the U.S. government by altering grade and attendance records in an effort to receive more federal student aid.&#8221; </p>

<p>After successfully challenging California&#8217;s teacher tenure rules in the courts, Student Matters is now looking to do the same in New Mexico, <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0415/morningeducation18095.html">says Politico</a>.</p>
