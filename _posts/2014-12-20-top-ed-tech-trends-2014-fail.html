<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 10 in <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com">my Top 10 Trends of 2014</a> series</em></p>

<p>2015 will mark the 25th anniversary of the first one-to-one laptop program. In 1990, the Methodist Ladies&rsquo; College in Melbourne, Australia gave all its students in Years 5 through 12 a computer. 2015 will mark the 35th anniversary of the publication of Seymour Papert&rsquo;s <em>Mindstorms</em>. It&rsquo;ll be the 15th anniversary of Maine Governor Angus King&rsquo;s proposal to give a laptop to every middle school student and teacher in the state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how the ed-tech industry will celebrate. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/06/18/unfathomable-cetis2014">As I&rsquo;ve argued elsewhere</a>, ed-tech suffers from amnesia, always forgetting or <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/533361/what-moocs-teach-us/">rewriting</a> its past. It&rsquo;s committed to a story that everything is new and that everything is wonderful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neither.</p>
<h3>The Great LAUSD iPad Fiasco</h3>
<br />
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty incredible that after decades of one-to-one computing initiatives, schools can still get things so very, very wrong. Or maybe it&rsquo;s not. Maybe that&rsquo;s what happens when you ignore history and research. Maybe that&rsquo;s what happens when you focus on <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/business.html">profits</a>, on <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/data">data collection</a>, on <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/moocs.html">content delivery</a>, on <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/ccss.html">assessment</a>.</p>
<p>When the Los Angeles Unified School District announced last year that it planned to give all 700,000 public school students an iPad (pre-loaded with a specially-designed Pearson curriculum), it was a very big deal &ndash; in terms of price-tag and publicity. <a href="https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/06/19Apple-Awarded-30-Million-iPad-Deal-From-LA-Unified-School-District.html">Apple even issued a press release</a>, boasting that it had been awarded the $30 million contract. $30 million out of an initiative expected to cost the district over $1 billion.</p>
<p>There were signs early on that LAUSD was struggling with the implementation. The district's WiFi infrastructure wasn&rsquo;t robust enough. It hadn&rsquo;t made plans or policies to deal with theft. And <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/students-are-hacking-their-school-issued-ipads-good-for-them/280196/">students quickly &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; their devices</a> &ndash; or at least, they bypassed the security profiles set up to prevent them from downloading music and watching movies.</p>
<p>But this year, LAUSD&rsquo;s iPad initiative has moved from being &ldquo;botched&rdquo; to being a full-blown scandal. Superintendent John Deasy <a href="http://home.lausd.net/apps/news/show_news.jsp?REC_ID=409683&amp;id=0">resigned</a>, as did the <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/chandler-lausds-head-of-it-resigns-in-face-of-misis-crisis/">district&rsquo;s CIO</a>. A <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-fbi-agents-take-ipad-documents-from-la-school-district-20141202-story.html">federal grand jury</a> has been called to look into the procurement process, although its <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/is-la-unified-the-target-of-fbi-probe-or-could-it-be-a-contractor/">unclear</a> if LAUSD or Apple or Pearson (or all of the above) is the target of the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ipads-explainer-20141204-story.html">criminal investigation</a>.</p>
<p>In August, several news organizations <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2014/08/22/17193/internal-emails-show-la-school-officials-started-i/">obtained and published emails</a> between LAUSD, Apple, and Pearson officials. These revealed that Superintendent Deasy had begun meeting with these companies &ndash; specifically <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2014/09/09/17266/la-schools-early-technology-plans-called-for-train/">with former Pearson CEO Marjorie Scardino</a> &ndash; to discuss the hardware/curriculum purchase almost a year before the contract ever went out to bid.</p>
<p>In response, Deasy announced he would <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-deasy-ipads-20140826-story.html">cancel</a> the contract with Apple, and that the district would reopen the bidding process. Deasy&rsquo;s replacement, Ramon Cortines, initially indicated that he&rsquo;d make major changes to the program, suggesting that he did not want to use construction bond money to fund it. But as has happened almost weekly with this story, <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/cortines-decision-on-bond-money-for-ipads-a-policy-u-turn/">things changed</a>. The contract with Apple was not cancelled &ndash; <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2014/11/19/17583/ipad-contract-resurected-lausd-to-spend-22-million/">not entirely</a> as the district announced it would spend $22 million to buy 20,000 more iPads just in time for spring standardized testing season. And instead of spending $504 per iPad, the district would pay $552 for each device.</p>
<p>In September, the American Institutes for Research (AIR) issued a 95-page <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1302852-air-evaluation-of-common-core-technology-project.html">report</a> evaluating the district&rsquo;s iPad project. It found that only one teacher out of 245 classrooms reported using the Pearson curriculum. (It&rsquo;s costing the district about $200 per device for a three-year licensing deal.) 80% of high schools <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-ipad-eval-20140918-story.html">reported</a> they &ldquo;rarely used the tablets.&rdquo; The report also found that the district was so busy dealing with the <em>distribution</em> of the iPads, it never really addressed using them in the classroom.</p>
<p>Bonus: in August, an audit found the district was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-ipad-audit-20140828-story.html">missing</a> $2 million in computers, mostly iPads.</p>
