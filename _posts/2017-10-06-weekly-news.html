<p><strong>Google</strong> had a big media to-do this week. Were there any education updates? Not sure. This story probably fits better under the surveillance section below. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/google-unveils-a-249-smart-camera-that-decides-whats-worth-photographing/">Via Ars Technica</a>: &#8220;Google unveils a $249 <strong>smart camera</strong> that decides what’s worth photographing.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-10-02-why-edtech-executives-are-keeping-a-close-eye-on-preschool-demographics">from Edsurge</a>, is pretty awful: &#8220;Why Edtech Executives Are Keeping a Close Eye on <strong>Preschool</strong> Demographics.&#8221; It ties in to Ivanka Trump&#8217;s interest in the <strong>PreK market</strong>, no doubt &#8211; see the top story above. (She&#8217;s an <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/twigtale">investor</a> in a company that targets that group.) So follow that narrative and network of financial relationships&#8230; But this article also underscores how everyone&#8217;s a market to ed-tech and how responsiveness to demographic shifts do not involve structural change but rather product development. </p>
