<h2>A Few Thoughts on &ldquo;Popular&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Often I feel like Hack Education operates at a strange intersection of &ldquo;popular&rdquo; and &ldquo;unpopular&rdquo; in the (ed-)tech blogosphere.</p>
<p>I refuse to chase pageviews. Creating link-baity headlines and SEO-optimized list posts might be good for a publication&rsquo;s traffic (and by extension, its ad revenues), but it does little to serve readers. It does even less to further critical inquiry or dialogue. We need <em>more</em> of that when it comes to teaching, learning, and technology &mdash; not less.</p>
<p>So I try to write without thinking too much about pageviews, even though I have to admit that it does matter to me that my work is read. I mean, of course it does. I think I have something to say; that&rsquo;s why I write. And even though I still view Hack Education as my personal site to rant and rave about what I see happening at the intersection of technology and education, I do need to make a living. I do need to cultivate an audience. I probably should pay attention to what folks want to read, click on, and share.</p>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been focusing less on "news" and more on "analysis" here, and looking at my Google Analytics at the year&rsquo;s end could help me weigh whether that&rsquo;s a smart decision or not. And note: there isn't much from "lately" on this list (although several of my Top Ed-Tech Trends posts would make the list if I extended it to 20). 3 of my most popular posts were breaking news stories (and I think several of these hit <a href="http://techmeme.com">Techmeme</a>, which gave me a spike in traffic), but most were analysis &mdash; or rather, rants.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I&rsquo;m not going to scrap my weekly roundup of news here on this site (those posts don&rsquo;t get a lot of pageviews) and instead only write about Khan Academy (great for pageviews) or Codecademy (also great for pageviews, but damn, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2012/11/03/comments/">the comments are brutal</a>). And I know I can&rsquo;t compete with the sites that Techmeme tends to highlight, with those that have a large staff of writers rapidly <a href="http://churnalism.com/">churning</a> out blog posts, or with those that reprint any infographic that hits their email inbox. Hell, I don&rsquo;t want to. Nor do I want to pen the ed-tech-as-revolution stories where &mdash; with apologies to Garrison Keeler &mdash; all the entrepreneurs and investors are virtuous, all the engineers and educators are geniuses, and thanks to adaptive learning, all the children&rsquo;s test scores are above average. You can find plenty of that elsewhere. I bet it's "popular" too...</p>
