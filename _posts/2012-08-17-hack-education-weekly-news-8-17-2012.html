<h2>Politics and Policies</h2>
<p>Last weekend, Republican Party Presidential nominee Mitt Romney named his running mate, Wisconsin Representative <strong>Paul Ryan</strong>. While some folks are saying that the selection &ldquo;<a href="http://www.eduwonk.com/2012/08/fou-reasons-the-paul-ryan-pick-doesnt-matter-a-lot-for-education.html">doesn&rsquo;t matter a lot for education</a>,&rdquo; others point to Ryan&rsquo;s record and suggest otherwise. In particular, Ryan has gone after Pell Grants and the National Endowment of the Humanities, proposing their budgets be slashed (or in the case of the NEH, eliminated altogether).</p>
<p>The Department of Education unveiled its latest <strong><a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-invites-districts-apply-400-million-race-top-competition-su">Race to the Top competition</a></strong>, this time pitting district against district (as opposed to state against stage) to compete for some $400 million in grants to be used for programs that &ldquo;personalize learning, close achievement gaps and take full advantage of 21st century tools that prepare each student for college and their careers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Georgia State Superintendent of Schools</strong> has come out in opposition to a proposed constitutional amendment in the state that would allow for a state board to fund charter schools even if local officials and school board members. &ldquo;I cannot support the creation of a new and costly state bureaucracy that takes away local control of schools and unnecessarily duplicates the good work already being done by local districts, the Georgia Department of Education, and the state Board of Education object,&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.ajc.com/get-schooled-blog/2012/08/14/barge-cant-support-diverting-430-million-from-schools-to-create-duplicate-bureaucracy-for-charter-school-approval/">says John Barge</a>.</p>
<p>The Department of Education is taking its show on the road again this fall with Arne Duncan&rsquo;s third <strong><a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/topic/bustour/">back-to-school bus tour</a></strong>.</p>
<h2>Launches and Updates</h2>
<p>The big news this week was the launch of <a href="http://khanacademy.tumblr.com/post/29417655743/computer-science"><strong>Khan Academy</strong>&rsquo;s new Computer Science curriculum</a>. It&rsquo;s not surprising since the creator of JQuery, John Resig, is part of the KA team that the first language students will tackle is JavaScript. Here&rsquo;s Resig&rsquo;s <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/introducing-khan-cs/">post</a> on the news, in which he points to last year&rsquo;s <a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">demo by Bret Victor</a> as inspiration. I haven&rsquo;t had a chance yet to dive into the offering, but early reports from <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=14804">my-main-math-man Dan Meyer</a> are positive. CS education prof Mark Guzdial <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/khan-academy-offers-kind-of-scaffolded-computer-science-learning-doing-away-with-the-teacher/">notes</a> that it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;very cool text editor. But it&rsquo;s a text editor.&rdquo; He also questions whether scaffolding in the new offering is really scaffolding.</p>

<h2>Research and Data</h2>
<p>Georgetown University&rsquo;s Center on Education and the Workforce has released a <a href="http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/CollegeAdvantage.FullReport.081512.pdf">new report</a> detailing the relationship between job gains and education level immediately before and after this recent recession, and the differences between those with and without college degrees are pretty stark. According to a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/how-the-great-recession-proved-beyond-a-doubt-the-value-of-a-college-degree/261225/">headline</a> in The Atlantic this proves &ldquo;beyond a doubt <strong>the value of a college degree</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
