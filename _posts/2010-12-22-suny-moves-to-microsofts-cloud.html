<p>It's been tit-for-tat much of the year, as different schools and states announce they've opted to "Go Google" or "Go Microsoft."  Yesterday, it was the latter's turn to boast a new contract as the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/dec10/12-21SUNYPR.mspx">State University of New York announced it was making Live@edu available</a> to its 64 campuses.</p>
<p>As with all these implementations, the move will offer the schools substantial savings, and will provide students and staff with a suite of online communication and collaboration tools.  Live@edu include email, calendaring, file storage and IM services.  70,000 students within SUNY already use Live@edu, and yesterday's announcement could boost that number to upwards of 465,000.  This makes it one of the largest campus deployment of Microsoft's cloud.</p>
<p><em>Dear SUNY Albany:  please use the cost-savings to reinstate the <a href="http://education.change.org/blog/view/suny-albany_students_and_faculty_mobilize_to_save_humanities_majors">humanities programs</a> you're trying to axe.  kkthx</em></p>
