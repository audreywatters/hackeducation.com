<p>President Obama announced a $100 million TechHire initiative that &#8220;aims to convince local governments, businesses, and individuals that a four-year degree is no longer the only way to gain valuable tech skills,&#8221; <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/techhire-initiative/">says Wired</a>.</p>
