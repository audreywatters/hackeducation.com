<p>When I went to write my year-in-review post in December on &#8220;<a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/business.html">The Business of Ed-Tech</a>,&#8221; I realized that I didn&#8217;t have the numbers I needed to calculate investment levels or to identify the biggest rounds of funding and the most active investors. So I swore I&#8217;d pick up a project that I started in 2013 but hadn&#8217;t maintained: the <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com">Ed-Tech Matrix</a>, an effort to map the industry&#8217;s investments and acquisitions.</p>

<p>As Frank Catalano notes in a recent <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/can-count-2-billion-education-technology-investment-hits-new-record/">GeekWire article</a> on 2014&#8217;s year of record-setting ed-tech investment, there are lots of different figures as to how much exactly was sunk into the sector. Among those tracking on investments (in ed-tech and beyond): CB Insights, Crunchbase, Ambient Insights, Mattermark, Edsurge, and the SEC. </p>

<p>So why create yet another tracking system?</p>

<p>Mostly it&#8217;s so that I can play with the data myself &#8211; the raw data, not just the graphs and charts and PDFs that others provide. (It&#8217;s time to learn a little about <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, I think. My first attempt: <em><a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/january2015.html">January's investments, visualized</a></em>.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not completely happy with the data model I&#8217;ve created, and I&#8217;ll probably tweak it a little before we get too far into the year. But if you&#8217;re interested, you can find the JSON files for January&#8217;s investment data <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/data/startup.json">here</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/HackEducation/Ed-Tech-Matrix">This project is on GitHub</a>. Feel free to fork.)</p>

<p><strong>Biggest funding of January</strong>: Lynda.com&#8217;s $186,000,000</p>
<p><strong>Biggest acquisition of January</strong>: Pluralsight&#8217;s acquisition of Code School for $36,000,000</p>

<p>Like I said back in December: it&#8217;s clear we&#8217;re seeing a growing emphasis on <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/skills.html">school as &#8220;skills.&#8221;</a> Both of these transactions highlight this trend.</p>
