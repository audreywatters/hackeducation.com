<p>Nope.  I did not write a story about Facebook's news today: the official announcement of a Facebook groups for .edu.  The social networking giant will now "go back to its roots" as many headlines read today, offering exclusive groups for universities.  I had a lot of questions about the news, but ugh, sorry.  I didn't feel like writing a story after every other tech blog covered it.  I tweeted my thoughts instead and BOOM, I storified it.</p>
