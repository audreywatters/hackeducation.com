<p><a href="http://microsoft.com"><strong>Microsoft</strong></a> announced this week that it has agreed to acquire the popular VOIP service <a href="http://skype.com"><strong>Skype</strong></a> for $8.5 billion.  Skype has become an important <a href="http://education.skype.com/">tool for educators</a> bridging classrooms around the world, and the acquisition may boost Microsoft's status in the education sector (provided, of course, Skype still works on Apple computers).</p>
<p>According to the June issue of <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/2011/june/money/how-to-protect-yourself/security-protection/index.htm">Consumer Reports</a>, <strong>Facebook</strong> has about 7.5 million users below the required minimum age of 13.  And 5 million of those users are ten or younger.</p>
<p>If teens and pre-teens love <strong>Facebook</strong>, they're less than enthralled with <strong>Foursquare</strong> and other location-based check-ins.  That's the findings of a recent survey by Dubit, a youth communications agency, reports <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/teenagers-think-foursquare-scvngr-and-facebook-places-are-creepy-and-pointless-2011-5">Business Insider</a>.  According to the survey, 48% of teens have not heard of Foursquare, Facebook Places, or other location services, and 67% of teens who have heard of the services don't use any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> has announced the semi-finalists for the <a href="http://www.google.com/events/sciencefair/vote_2.html"><strong>Google Science Fair</strong></a>.  Voting on these entries runs through May 20.</p>
<p><strong>Wolfram Alpha</strong> has released two new Course Assistant apps, this time for <a href="http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2011/05/13/wolfram-general-chemistry-and-precalculus-course-assistant-apps-come-to-ios/">pre-calculus and chemistry</a>.  The former costs $1.99 and the latter costs $4.99.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/05/13/new_survey_on_student_technology_preferences">Inside Higher Ed</a> reports on a new survey by Student Monitor that finds that print textbooks are popular on campuses -- far more popular than e-books -- due in part to a thriving textbook rental business.  24% of students say they've rented at least one textbook this year, up from 12% this time last year.  Only 5% say they've purchased a digital textbook.</p>
<p><strong>Disney</strong> subsidiary <a href="http://www.playdom.com"><strong>Playdom</strong></a>, an online gaming company that makes a number of popular children's games, has agreed to pay the <strong>FTC</strong> $3 million over charges that it violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by illegally collecting and then exposing children's personal data without receiving consent from parents.</p>
<p>In more kids and advertising news, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/05/12/apple-pulls-iads-from-kids%E2%80%99-app/">The Wall Street Journal</a> reports that that <strong>Apple</strong> has pulled iAds.  Appmaker <a href="http://blog.clickablebliss.com/"><strong>Clickablebliss</strong></a> says that apps were pulled from its Pokemon app Dex, an indication that Apple may be revisiting what sorts of mobile apps appear in ads targeted at children.</p>
<p>A UK charity which aims to promote the study of computer science at school <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/"><strong>Raspberry Pi Foundation</strong></a> is working to develop low-cost computers for use in teaching programming in schools in both the developed and developing world.  The organization has released its first product, a device about the size of a USB stick, that's designed to plug into a TV or touch screen in order to make a low cost tablet.  The computer is expected to cost about $25.</p>
<p>Researchers danah boyd and Alice Marwick have released a draft of their paper on teens' attitudes towards online privacy.  You can read the paper <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2011/05/09/how-teens-understand-privacy.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.staysafeonline.org/sites/default/files/resource_documents/2011%20National%20K-12%20Study%20Final_0.pdf"><strong>National Cyber Security Alliance</strong></a> released a study on the state of cybersecurity and cybersafety in the K-12 curriculum.  Like many surveys, the results point to a gulf between administrators, teachers, and students in their assessments of how technology instruction works.  81% of school administrators, for example, said they believe their districts are adequately preparing students in online safety but only 51% of teachers agree.</p>
<p>At its annual developer conference this week, <strong>Google</strong> announced a "new kind of computer" -- a cloud-based netbook-like laptop based on its new operating system Chrome OS.  These <a href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/business-education.html"><strong>Chromebooks</strong></a> will be offered to schools via a $20 per month per student rental program.  I wrote my initial thoughts on the program on both <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/will_chromebooks_for_education_be_a_good_deal_for.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> and <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/05/is-your-school-ready-for-googles-chromebooks-for-education/">MindShift</a>.</p>
