<p style="text-align: left;">Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>In this week's podcast we discuss:</p>
<p><strong>0:33</strong>: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/04/09/the-failure-of-olpc/">One Laptop Per Child and standardized testing</a>. How do we judge the success or failure of the OLPC initiative? &nbsp;What's the progression of learning devices and their applications?</p>
<p><strong>8:13</strong>: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/04/10/the-department-of-education-on-educational-data-mining/">Education and the coming data deluge</a>. &nbsp;A couple of initiatives from the Department of Education that raise question about learning analytics, data mining, and data ownership.</p>
<p><strong>27:33</strong>: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/04/12/crowdfunding-academic-research-microryza/">Crowdfunding scientific research</a>. &nbsp;How will this change what gets funded? &nbsp;How might Microryza's plans to open up the process of scientific research change who participates -- financially and otherwise -- in the process?</p>
<p><strong>31:30</strong>: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/04/14/ed-tech-weekly-news-roundup-april-14/">Caine's Arcade</a>. &nbsp;No doubt the best education story of the week -- what can we learn from this video?</p>
