<p><em>Part 2 in my "<a href="http://2011trends.hackeducation.com">Top 10 Ed-Tech Trends of 2011</a>" series.</em></p>
<h3>The Growth of Social</h3>
<br />
<p>The human population hit the <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=human-population-reaches-seven-billion">7 billion</a> mark this year. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics">800 million</a> of us are now on Facebook. And that old "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">six degrees of separation</a>" thing? Facebook says that thanks to its network, there are actually just <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-team/anatomy-of-facebook/10150388519243859">4.74 degrees</a> that separate us all. We're all closer now, so the story goes, thanks to social media.</p>
<p>That's opened a world of possibilities in education. No longer need a teacher feel isolated in the classroom. Even if there isn't a strong support network at her/his school, there are incredible ones online. No longer need PD be scheduled; it's on-demand and real-time. No longer need it be imposed from "above"; educators have built their own learning communities online.</p>
<p>And it's opened a world of possibilities for students too -- the ability to communicate, collaborate, and study with their peers online.</p>
<p>There have been a number of ed-tech companies move to cater to the social (media) learning trend -- and not just this year, of course, as educators' usage of social media is hardly new. (It was one of the important trends that I identified for <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/12/09/the-year-in-ed-tech-part-4-social-learning-social-networks">2010</a> too.) But perhaps one of the best indicators of schools' adoption of social media this year is the hockey-stick-like growth of <a href="http://edmodo.com">Edmodo</a>. At the end of 2010, the startup announced it had <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/12/07/edmodo-announces-1-million-users-funding-from-union-ventures">1 million users</a>; by the end of October 2011, that number had more than <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/edmodo/status/131197003374931968">quadrupled</a>.</p>
