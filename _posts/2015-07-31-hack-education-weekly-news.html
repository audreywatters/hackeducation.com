<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>The Obama administration will announce today that it will offer Pell Grants to some prisoners, &#8220;the first adult inmates to be eligible for the grants since Congress barred prisoners from receiving them more than 20 years ago,&#8221; <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/232063/">says The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>. <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/barack-obama-financial-aid-college-federal-state-prisoners-pell-grant-120680.html">More via Politico</a>.</p>

<h3>Testing, Testing&#8230;</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/college-board-rewrites-american-history/2015/07/30/cadadd4c-36d1-11e5-b673-1df005a0fb28_story.html">Caving to pressure from conservatives</a>, the College Board is <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/07/31/revised-ap-us-history-framework-seeks-calm-critics">revising its AP US History curriculum</a> in order to include more about the founding fathers, less about dead Native Americans, and to make Ronald Reagan and Manifest Destiny sound less horrible. As Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson suggested, after taking the previous new version of the AP, &#8220;I think most people, when they finish that course, they&#8217;d be ready to sign up for ISIS.&#8221;</p>

<h3>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h3>
<br />
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that Udacity is pounding the pavement, trying to drum up interest in a new round of investment. Why? Because a number of articles about the company published this week, all using the phrase &#8220;Uber for Education&#8221; &#8211; an analogy that venture capitalists understand about a company that currently boasts a very high valuation. Of course, I&#8217;d ask why the hell we&#8217;d want Uber in education &#8211; unethical practices, privacy issues, refusal to accommodate people with disabilities, a dismantling of legal and labor protections (&#8220;Mr Thrun knows what he doesn't want for his company; professors in tenure&#8221;) and of public infrastructure. But hey. You won&#8217;t find any tough questions in this <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/539106/uber-for-education/">MIT Technology Review</a> or <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/3a3af70a-1a74-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996.html">Financial Times</a> write-up. </p>

<p>Facebook is <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/facebook-managing-bias-course/">publishing its course</a> on how to manage bias in the workplace so that other tech companies can learn from it. LOL as Facebook&#8217;s workplace diversity is <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/06/facebook-diversity-2015/">pathetic</a>: &#8220;Last year, 31 percent of staffers were women. This year, it&#8217;s 32. Last year, 2 percent of its employees were black. This year, it&#8217;s exactly the same. The number of women filling tech jobs at the company slid slightly, from the already paltry 16 percent to 15 percent.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Data, Privacy, and Surveillance</h3>
<br />
<p>The inBloom dream is back, revived by Carnegie Mellon University, thanks to $5 million in funding from the feds to build &#8220;the biggest open repository of education data&#8221; in the world, <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/carnegie-mellon-project-revives-failed-inbloom-dream-to-store-and-analyze-student-data/">says The Hechinger Report</a>.
