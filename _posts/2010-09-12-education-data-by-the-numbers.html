<p>I remain deeply skeptical, if not outright opposed to the whole "<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/08/22/the-data-driven-educator/">value-add</a>" method of teacher evaluation.  As I've argued before, if we get too caught up in tracking test scores, we will miss out on a lot of other things we need to look at to assess teaching and learning.</p>
<p>That being said, there is an incredible wealth of data -- numbers of all sorts -- to look through.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://edmoney.org/data/schools/">EDMoney.org</a> tracks spending of ARRA funds in states, school districts and schools.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eddataexpress.ed.gov/">ED Data Express</a> is the Department of Education's project, and the site include demographic, budget and assessment data. </li>
</ul>
<p>After looking at how Pete Warden <a href="http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2010/09/where-are-las-most-effective-schools.html">mapped the data</a> from the LA Times article using his OpenHeatMap tool, I bet there are some more interesting visualizations and analyses to be had here.</p>
