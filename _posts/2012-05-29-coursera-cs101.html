<p>I did it! I made it all the way through a MOOC, submitting the final assignment in&nbsp;<a href="http://coursera.com/">Coursera</a>&rsquo;s Computer Science 101 this afternoon.</p>
<p>I seem to have a penchant for signing up and dropping out of these massive online classes. I never made it too far in the CS 101 course offered by Coursera&rsquo;s rival&nbsp;<a href="http://udacity.com/">Udacity</a>. Oh, I have the best of intention when I enroll in all sorts of open education opportunities, and I start courses with a fair amount of enthusiasm. I follow along for a week or two, and then,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/udacitys-cs101-partial-course-evaluation">for a variety of reasons</a>&nbsp;&ndash; life, the universe, and everything &ndash; my commitment fades away.</p>
<p>But I swore I&rsquo;d stick this particular Coursera class out to the end, and honestly I have to say that that&rsquo;s what got me through &ndash; a commitment I made to myself. It wasn&rsquo;t the design or the content or the pedagogy or the platform. It was me and my refusal to quit. I tried to be more organized. I added &ldquo;homework due&rdquo; to my calendar and purposefully scheduled time to work on the class. All this sounds like a &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo; when it comes to taking a course, but it&rsquo;s been incredibly easy for me in the past to ignore the requirements of MOOCs as my participation isn&rsquo;t mandatory, let alone noticed.</p>
<p>When I tuned in to the last lecture by Stanford CS professor Nick Parlante today, I was actually a little surprised that we'd reached the end of the course. I wasn&rsquo;t really paying attention to the length of the &ldquo;semester&rdquo; (6 weeks in this case), and as such I wasn&rsquo;t really making a mental map of how much and how far I had to travel to make it from beginning to end. The class was enjoyable and the time in it passed quickly. But I can't help but wonder about my uncertainty&nbsp;about the duration and direction in classes &ndash; I felt this before in Udacity. I wonder if it contributes to my feeling lost and rudderless in these MOOCs.</p>
<p>When I wrote my (admittedly partial)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/udacitys-cs101-partial-course-evaluation">course evaluation</a>&nbsp;of Udacity&rsquo;s CS101, I said I liked its project-based focus and the short duration of its videos (2&ndash;5 minutes in length). I didn&rsquo;t mind the frequent quizzes. And I liked the instructor, University of Virginia professor David Evans. I said I &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t sure&rdquo; about the level of difficulty, the forums, or the &ldquo;robot-grader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am sure about those those latter elements now:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/5-things-ive-learned-moocs-about-how-i-learn">robot-graders</a>&nbsp;can be incredibly frustrating, and forums can make for poor learning communities.</p>
<p>In many ways, my evaluation of Coursera&rsquo;s CS101 is similar to my evaluation of Udacity&rsquo;s introductory CS course: I liked the professor; I didn&rsquo;t mind the homework.</p>
<p>I did really miss the project-based focus that the Udacity class offered (it had students work towards building a search engine). The Coursera class felt very much like a traditional lecture-based class, just one broadcast online. Indeed, some of the videos were Professor Parlante&rsquo;s lectures at Stanford, although most of them involved him talking into the camera, sharing a split-screen with his lecture notes. That&rsquo;s a different filmic techique than the Udacity CS101 lectures, which were shot over-the-shoulder so you can see Professor Evans write and code. The videos for the Coursera class were much longer than Udacity&rsquo;s too &ndash; 20+ minutes of lectures sometimes. (<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/5-things-ive-learned-moocs-about-how-i-learn">Ugh</a>.)</p>

<p>One of the questions I had about the Udacity CS101 class was what exactly constitutes an introductory computer science class. I admit here to no disciplinary knowledge of what that should be, and perhaps there&rsquo;s no right or wrong answer. But for me the Coursera class struck the right cord. It covered a lot of fundamentals: bytes, bits, networking, security, variables, strings, Boolean logic. It tied these concepts to manipulating images, sound, and spreadsheets. It covered a lot of material over the 6 weeks. A survey course, sometimes I felt it ran through too many topics too quickly. Maybe that&rsquo;s a good thing though: I want to learn more now.</p>
<p>Professor Parlante noted in his final lecture that there isn&rsquo;t a clear &ldquo;next step&rdquo; for me. At least, there isn&rsquo;t a Coursera CS102 for me to enroll in. He made some suggestions of what to pursue next: working with spreadsheets, perhaps, or HTML5. Perhaps an introductory programming class. My first thought when he said that? Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to try Udacity CS101 again.</p>
