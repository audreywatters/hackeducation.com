<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. Well, every week or so. We skipped a week. And while I had to Skype in (virtually), Steve actually recorded this "live before a studio audience" in Phoenix. (You can see <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2012/12/09/hargadon-talking/">"CogDog" Alan Levine's take on the event</a> as he was there.)</p>
<p>In this podcast, Steve and I work our way through several of the <a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=ed-tech%20trends%202012">trends I'm covering in my massive year-end series</a>. Listening to it, I sound really jet-lagged as I'd just returned from Paris. (My apologies for the jetlag. Not apologizing for going to France though!)</p>
