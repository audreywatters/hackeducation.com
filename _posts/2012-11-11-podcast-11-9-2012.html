<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>In this week's recording, we discuss the changes to Flat World Knowledge as well as results from Election Night and how these will (or won't) change education policy in the coming years.</p>
<p>The link to the MP3 of the show is below, and/or you can subscribe to  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/edtechlive/hackeducation">the podcast feed</a>. You can also find the podcast in iTunes, as part of Steve's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/edtechlive/id219875737">EdTechLive series</a>.</p>
