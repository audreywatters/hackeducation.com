<p><em>Number 9 in my <a href="http://2011trends.hackeducation.com">Top 10 Ed-Tech Trends of 2011 Series</a></em></p>

<p>When I made my <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/2011_predictions_audrey_watters.php">10 tech predictions for 2011</a> for RWW last year, I included the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>6. Openly-licensed content - open education resources, open source, open data - will thrive, as more people question outmoded intellectual property laws. Nonetheless, there'll still be patent and copyright infringement lawsuits aplenty.</p></blockquote>

<p>Looking back on 2011, I don't really feel like I can pat myself on the back about that prediction. I don't think I can cheer, "woohoo, I got it right." What I wrote was so very bland and vague. And while I can chronicle all sorts of interesting developments in openly licensed content this year, I'm not sure that verb I chose in December 2010 -- "thrive" -- is quite the right one for December 2011. Have we really seen intellectual property laws questioned this year (See: Andy Baio's article "<a href="http://waxy.org/2011/12/no_copyright_intended/">No Copyright Intended</a>")? Or are we seeing them re-inscribed (See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">SOPA</a>)?</p>

<p>That's not to say that 2011 hasn't been an important year for openly-licensed content, open educational resources, open source, open access. Indeed, it's been quite an interesting year for the adjective "open."</p>
