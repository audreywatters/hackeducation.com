<p>Google is looking for data about how Android App Investor is being used in educational settings in order to help define the project's development and outreach.  If you've used App Investor (or plan to do so) as part of a school or organization in order to teach kids (or adults, for that matter) to code, Google would like to hear from you.</p>
<p>The survey closes on Wednesday, January 12.  You can complete it <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dG04cGpYYUlnb1ZEdGg3cmJlQk5ENFE6MQ">here</a>.</p>
