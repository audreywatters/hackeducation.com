<p>The learning management system upstart&nbsp;<a href="http://instructure.com/">Instructure</a>&nbsp;is unveiling&nbsp;<a href="http://www.instructure.com/k12">Canvas K-12</a>&nbsp;today, a version of its platform aimed &mdash; as the name suggests &mdash; for the K-12 level. The company says that it&rsquo;s already had over a dozen school districts adopt Canvas, even before this roll-out of a specially designed LMS.</p>
<p>Traditionally the LMS has been something implemented primarily by colleges and universities, but as more and more K-12 schools move to online learning and digital curriculum, there&rsquo;s a growing demand at that level. It&rsquo;s a hot market, and according to research published in December 2011 by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.simbainformation.com/PreK-Learning-Management-6059481/">Simba Information</a>, &ldquo;the LMS segment is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.3%, reaching $377 million by the 2014-2015 school year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As such, it&rsquo;s hardly surprising to see some of the big education companies make their move to offer schools these services. The acquisition of&nbsp;<a href="http://edline.com/">Edline</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="http://blackboard.com/">Blackboard</a>&nbsp;last fall made it clear that the learning management giant was serious about its&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/06/30/whats-next-for-blackboard/">push into that market</a>.</p>
<p>But as the Simba research suggests, it&rsquo;s a market that&rsquo;s still up for grabs. While Blackboard still holds a little over half of the higher ed LMS market, Blackboard, Pearson and Moodle altogether share only about 30% of the K-12 market.</p>
<p>That provides an interesting opportunity for Instructure, which&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/02/01/why-im-not-that-excited-about-the-new-lms-instructure/">officially launched</a>&nbsp;its cloud-based LMS this time last year.</p>
