<h2>Stories I Told</h2>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/02/22/no-kno-not-now-not-ever/">No Kno</a>, as the student tablet maker is planning to abandon its manufacturing efforts</li>
<li><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/this_library_e-book_will_self-destruct_after_26_ch.php">This Library E-Book Will Self-Destruct After 26 Check Outs</a> -- Sometimes publishers act like <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/ebooks/">e-books</a> are just like print books.  You can lend them out to only one person at a time, for example.  And sometimes publishers make new rules -- a reminder that e-books are indeed different.  Case in point:  HarperCollins says libraries can only lend a digital copy of a title 26 times, then the copy is revoked.</li>
<li>A study, sponsored by the MacArthur Foundation has found that contrary to stereotypes of echo chambers and slacktivists that the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/study_finds_the_internet_makes_youth_more_engaged.php">Internet actually encourages youth to be more engaged citizens</a></li>
<li>One state "goes <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/google">Google</a>."  Another chooses Microsoft.  A few thoughts on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_versus_microsoft_the_battle_for_the_k-12_cl.php">the battle for the K-12 Cloud Contract</a></li>
<li>Looking forward to a billion minds served:  <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mit_opencourseware_turns_10_celebrating_a_decade_o.php">MIT OpenCourseWare Turns 10: What's Next for Open Education</a>?</li>
<li>Sorta more <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/internet_archive_partners_with_150_libraries_to_la.php">open lending</a> as the Internet Archive partners with 150 libraries to launch an e-book lending program</li>

<h2>Stories I Missed</h2>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>A big congratulations to <a href="http://smarthistory.org/">Smarthistory</a>, the free and open art history <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/textbooks/">textbook</a>.  It reached its $10,000 <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/360446359/smarthistory-art-history-conversation">Kickstarter</a> goal this evening.  The funding will help the site build out its video library, in order to help it become a viable alternative to the traditional (and expensive) Intro to Art History textbook.</li>
<li>A less than sunny outlook for <a href="http://hackeducation.com/tag/open-educational-resources">open content</a> is depicted in the recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/arts/music/22music-imslp.html">New York Times story</a> on the <a href="http://imslp.org/">International Music Score Library Project</a>.  Is the refrain of "publishers need new business models to deal with digital content" getting old yet?</li>
<li>I admit, I was fascinated by <a>Marc Parry's story in </a><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/a-wikileaks-clone-takes-on-higher-education/29947">The Chronicle</a> on <a href="http://www.unileaks.org/">Unileaks</a>, a whistleblower site for higher ed. </li>
<li>What needs to happen in order to make cellphones work in school?  Marie Bjerede writes about some of the <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/02/cell-phones-school.html">tech we might need</a> in O'Reilly Radar</li>
