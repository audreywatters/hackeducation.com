<p>I told myself this year that I had to get better at asking folks to support the work I do on this website. I added a blurb to the bottom of <a href="http://tinyletter.com/audreywatters">my newsletter</a>, for example, informing readers that this site is not funded by ads or investors or corporations or philanthropic organizations. Well, I added that blurb, like, twice. And then I forgot.</p>

<p>I always remember this time of year, when I&#8217;m in the middle of writing the series of stories I publish on the &#8220;<a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">Top Ed-Tech Trends</a>&#8221; (and feeling fairly overwhelmed by the task) that I need to remind people that there are a couple of ways to support my work.</p>

<p>You can donate <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">via PayPal</a> or become a monthly subscriber. You can support me <a href="https://www.patreon.com/audreywatters">via Patreon</a>. (You can hire me to speak on your campus or at your event, yes, but I&#8217;d also love to have a more regular monthly income that doesn&#8217;t involve travel or public speaking.)</p>

<p>I have Hack Education stickers that I can send you as a gesture of &#8220;thanks.&#8221; There are also now <a href="https://teespring.com/stores/hack-education-2016-fundraiser">Hack Education t-shirts</a> (for a very, very limited time). </p>

<p>But I don&#8217;t want to be in the sticker business. And I don&#8217;t want to be in the t-shirt business. I want to write education technology criticism. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support">Your support helps me continue to do just that</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
