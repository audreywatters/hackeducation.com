<p><em>Each week, I gather a wide variety of links to education and education technology articles. All this feeds the series I write each December on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the stories we are told</a> about the future of education. (That series isn&#8217;t going to be much of one this year&#8230; And frankly, this Friday thing is going to be paused for the duration of Teaching Machines book-writing, starting quite soon. So enjoy all this educational doom while you can.)</em></p>

He&#8217;s drawing on <strong>Francis Fukuyama</strong>&#8217;s famous (and wildly incorrect) pronouncement about &#8220;The End of History,&#8221; so make of this what you will. Fukuyama was wrong. Liberal democracy was not triumphant. Arguably it is no longer even ascendant. So similarly, let&#8217;s not tout this moment as one where recent changes to education can never be undone. Good grief. Take a look at school segregation and surveillance before you start touting some fabricated moment of satisfactory &#8220;homeostasis.&#8221;</p>
