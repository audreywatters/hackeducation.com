<h2>Science is Awesome</h2>
<p>36 years after it was launched, <strong>Voyager I</strong> has moved out of the sun&rsquo;s reach and has <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/09/voyager-left-solar-system/">entered interstellar space</a>, the first human-made object to do so. I blame our failing schools. Oh. Wait.</p>
<h2>Science is Awful</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/pink-slime-school-lunches-96502.html"><strong>Pink slime</strong>. It&rsquo;s back in school lunches</a>.</p>
<h2>Massive Open* Online Courses (*Some Restrictions May Apply)</h2>
<p><strong>San Jose State University</strong> has released its <a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/chemistry/People/Faculty/Collins_Research_Page/index.html">report</a> on the spring pilot program it ran with <strong>Udacity</strong>. The NSF-funded research doesn&rsquo;t really offer any surprises here: student &ldquo;effort, measured in a variety of ways, trumps all other variables tested for their relationships to student success.&rdquo; More analysis of the report from <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/09/12/after-weeks-delays-san-jose-state-u-releases-research-report-online-courses">Inside Higher Ed</a>, <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/sjsu-research-report-confirms-moocs-online-courses/">Phil Hill</a>, and <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/blackboard-d2l-udacity-and-sjsu/">Michael Feldstein</a>.</p>
<p>Timed with an appearance on stage at Techcrunch Disrupt by Sebastian Thrun and California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, <strong>Udacity</strong> announced the <strong><a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2013/09/announcing-launch-of-open-education.html">Open Education Alliance</a></strong>, a partnership with several tech companies, which has <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2922">jack shit</a> to do with &ldquo;open education,&rdquo; but hey, it&rsquo;s co-opted &ldquo;MOOC&rdquo; so why not this phrase too.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> is "<a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2013/09/we-are-joining-open-edx-platform.html">joining the &ldquo;open <strong>Edx</strong> platform</a>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not really clear what that entails &ndash; I mean, other than making &ldquo;open&rdquo; even murkier &ndash; as it says it will continue to maintain the open source code for its Course Builder software &ldquo;but are focusing our development efforts on Open edX.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/10/mooc_org_google_edx_online_classes_partnership_is_youtube_for_moocs.html">Slate</a> calls the partnership a &ldquo;YouTube for MOOCs,&rdquo; so the comments section (&ldquo;forums&rdquo;) should be an awesome place to learn. See also: <a href="http://mooc.org">MOOC.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> announced this week that it&rsquo;s earned $1 million in revenue from its Signature Track courses. (The company has raised some <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/coursera">$65 million</a> in venture funding.) According to <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/61047298750/a-milestone-for-signature-track-certificates-for-the">its blog post</a>, &ldquo;Over 70% of the students earning them already have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher.&rdquo; One happy customer says that "The Verified Certificate boosts my credibility in my new role as CTO of a startup. We use gamification in our products for employee growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>HarvardX</strong> Neuroscience MOOC <a href="http://www.mcb80x.org/">MCB80x</a> is running a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mcb80x/neuroscience-for-the-people-bring-diy-science-to-t">Kickstarter</a> to raise funds so that students in the class will all get a &ldquo;spikerbox,&rdquo; a DIY neuroscience kit made by <strong><a href="http://www.backyardbrains.com/">Backyard Brains</a></strong>. (I covered Backyard Brains <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2011/12/wiring-insects-for-hands-on-science-experiments/">here</a>.)</p>

<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2013/09/09/first-stemx-mooc-takes-place-sept.-19-21.aspx"><strong>ISTE</strong> is running a MOOC</a>. Well, it&rsquo;s a STEM conference, but marketed as a MOOC. Because of course.</p>
<p><strong>HarvardX</strong> has released enrollment data for its courses, with 43% of participants coming from the US. More numbers and an interactive visualization <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/9/5/edx-enrollment-harvardx-india/">via The Harvard Crimson</a>.</p>
<p>Karen Head wraps up her <a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/lessons-learned-from-a-freshman-composition-mooc/46337">Chronicle series</a> on the &ldquo;First-Year Composition 2.0&rdquo; MOOC she taught on the <strong>Coursera</strong> platform, with a look at what was &ldquo;successful&rdquo; and not about the course. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any of us (writing and communication instructors) would rush to teach another MOOC soon. For now, the technology is lacking for courses in subject areas like writing, which have such strong qualitative evaluation requirements. Too often we found our pedagogical choices hindered by the course-delivery platform we were required to use, when we felt that the platform should serve the pedagogical requirements. Too many decisions about platform functionality seem to be arbitrary, or made by people who may be excellent programmers but, I suspect, have never been teachers.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p>Tamara Cotman, a school administrator in <strong>Atlanta</strong> brought up in charges relating to the school system&rsquo;s <strong>cheating scandal</strong>, was found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/education/first-trial-ends-in-acquittal-in-school-scandal-in-atlanta.html">not guilty</a> on Friday of influencing witnesses during a government investigation. This was the first case brought to trial in that investigation, one that led to the indictments of over 30 educators, including the school superintendent Beverly Hall.</p>
<p><strong>Sallie Mae</strong> has <a href="http://www.prwatch.org/node/12237">dropped its membership</a> from the American Legislative Exchange Council (<strong>ALEC</strong>).

<p>Negotiations got underway in DC this week for new &ldquo;<strong>gainful employment</strong>&rdquo; regulations. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/09/10/gainful-employment-negotatiors-face-long-odds-reaching-consensus">Inside Higher Ed has more</a> on the proposals and rule-making sessions.</p>
<p><strong>The Department of Education</strong> has <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/09/09/5148138/feds-deny-texas-request-for-waiver.html">denied</a> <strong>Texas</strong>&rsquo;s request to waive NCLB testing requirements of elementary and middle school students.</p>
<p><strong>The Department of Education</strong> told <strong>California</strong> that it couldn&rsquo;t scrap its NCLB-mandated state testing system in order to field test the new Common Core tests. Arne Duncan has threatened to withhold funds if it does so. But the state legislature has <a href="http://www.edsource.org/today/2013/despite-looming-showdown-with-feds-senate-passes-standardized-testing-bill/38773#.UjM8w2SAfaJ">moved forward</a> regardless, passing legislation that would suspend standardized testing for a non-high-stakes test of new assessments.</p>
<p>Lots of back and forth this week on whether or not former <strong>Indiana</strong> (and now too former Florida) schools head <strong>Tony Bennett</strong> has been <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/rick_hess_straight_up/2013/09/tony_bennett_exonerated.html">exonerated</a> in the grade-changing controversy that prompted his resignation.

<p>The SEIU has <a href="http://dailyemerald.com/2013/09/12/seiu-authorizes-strike-against-oregon-university-system-asuo-calls-for-student-walkout/">authorized a strike</a> against the <strong>Oregon University system</strong>. The UO student union is calling for a student walk out in support. In its negotiations with administrators, the UO faculty union (different from the SEIU) is <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/09/12/oregon-professors-object-contract-language-divorcing-academic-freedom-free-speech">concerned</a> that the university plans to &ldquo;decouple academic freedom and free speech.&rdquo; But, hey, the football team is 2&ndash;0 and that&rsquo;s what really matters. <strong>Go Ducks</strong>.</p>

<h2>Downgrades and Closures</h2>
<p>Y Combinator-backed tutoring startup <strong>Tutorspree</strong> is closing its doors &ldquo;because we could not make it the company we wanted,&rdquo; the founders <a href="http://blog.tutorspree.com/post/60655061386/thank-you">write on their blog</a>. PandoDaily&rsquo;s Erin Griffith <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/09/08/after-difficult-fundraise-yc-alum-tutorspree-shuts-down/">writes up news of the closure</a>, suggesting that &ldquo;Some in the ed-tech industry believe there was an investment bubble for early stage ed-tech startups and it has popped. General VC&rsquo;s are not as eager to invest in early stage education as they were six to 12 months ago, several industry observers said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in &ldquo;almost ready to close news,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s <strong>Dabble</strong>, an education startup that&rsquo;s turning its struggles into a &ldquo;30 Days of Honesty&rdquo; blog series, detailing &ldquo;their day-to-day struggles and personal doubts about running Dabble. Each day, they write openly about debates over raising prices so they can take a greater cut, asking readers for marketing tips and questioning how long they&rsquo;ll feel comfortable committing to the company.&rdquo; <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/09/08/dabble-30-days-honesty-startup/">Mashable</a> picked up the story, so hey, maybe there&rsquo;s hope.</p>
