There was some talk that, despite being vociferously <strong>anti-union</strong>, Michelle Rhee&#8217;s support for the <strong>Common Core</strong> was allegedly <a href="https://edsource.org/2016/rhees-support-of-common-core-could-be-deal-breaker-in-possible-trump-appointment/573082">a deal-breaker</a>. Of course, DeVos has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/politics/betsy-devos-picked-for-education-secretary/">supported groups</a> that back the Common Core in the past, including <strong>Jeb Bush</strong>&#8217;s Foundation for Excellence in Education. (She serves on its board.) <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-11-23-what-we-know-about-betsy-devos-trump-s-pick-for-education-secretary">Edsurge parrots</a> DeVos&#8217;s tweet &#8211; &#8220;I am not a supporter &#8211; period&#8221; &#8211; without any questions about this sudden change of heart. Edsurge says she likes ed-tech though so "<a href="https://thenib.com/this-is-not-fine">everything's fine</a>."</p>

<p><strong>Betsy DeVos</strong> is part of the DeVos family, of the <strong>Amway Corporation</strong> fame. &#8220;The DeVoses sit alongside the Kochs, the Bradleys, and the Coorses as founding families of the <strong>modern conservative movement</strong>,&#8221; <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/01/devos-michigan-labor-politics-gop">Mother Jones wrote in 2014</a>. &#8220;Since 1970, DeVos family members have invested at least $200 million in a host of right-wing causes -- think tanks, media outlets, political committees, evangelical outfits, and a string of advocacy groups. They have helped fund nearly every prominent Republican running for national office and underwritten a laundry list of conservative campaigns on issues ranging from <strong>charter schools</strong> and <strong>vouchers</strong> to <strong>anti-gay-marriage</strong> and <strong>anti-tax</strong> ballot measures.&#8221;</p>

<p>DeVos&#8217;s brother, <strong>Erik Prince</strong>, is the founder of the private military company <strong>Blackwater</strong>, infamous for its human rights violations, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisour_Square_massacre">the murder of 17 Iraqi civilians in 2007</a> by its employees. Prince and the DeVos family have been <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/11/15/mike-pence-will-be-the-most-powerful-christian-supremacist-in-us-history/">major supporters of Indiana Governor and now Vice President-Elect <strong>Mike Pence</strong></a>, particularly for his efforts to <strong>outlaw gay marriage</strong> and <strong>criminalize abortion</strong>.</p>

<p>From 1995 to 2005, DeVos sat on the board of the <strong>Acton Institute</strong>, which <a href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/89837-bring-back-child-labor-work-is-a-gift-our-kids-can-handle.html">recently published a blog post</a> decrying <strong>child labor</strong> laws.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/08/17/tax-dragnet-second-homes-snags-billionaires-others/88932834/">Earlier this year</a>, the DeVos family lost a huge tax break on their property after <strong>Michigan</strong>&#8217;s Department of Treasury investigated <strong>improper exemptions</strong>. Reminder: paying <strong>property taxes</strong> helps fund public schools. Not paying property taxes means you do not support public schools.</p>

<p>Oh. I see&#8230;</p>

<p>DeVos&#8217;s support for <strong>charter schools</strong> and <strong>vouchers</strong> are the signature of her efforts in <strong>Michigan</strong>, which has the <strong>least regulated charter school system in the country</strong> &#8211; &#8220;The Poster Child for How Not to do Charter Schools,&#8221; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amber-arellano/michigan-the-poster-child_b_9210754.html">according to HuffPo</a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/betsy-devos-trumps-education-pick-has-steered-money-from-public-schools.html">As The New York Times notes</a>, &#8220;The <strong>Detroit</strong>, <strong>Flint</strong> and <strong>Grand Rapids</strong> school districts have among the nation&#8217;s 10 largest shares of students in charters, and the state sends $1 billion in education funding to charters annually. Of those schools, 80 percent are run by for-profit organizations, a far higher share than anywhere else in the nation.&#8221; The choice of DeVos, according to Slate&#8217;s Dana Goldstein, would &#8220;<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2016/11/how_trump_and_education_secretary_betsy_devos_could_gut_public_education.html"><strong>gut public education</strong></a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>More on Trump&#8217;s pick &#8211; and do note how her views are often <strong>normalized</strong> and their abhorrence <strong>minimized</strong> by journalists &#8211; from <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/11/23/499642077/trump-chooses-betsy-devos-for-education-secretary">NPR</a>, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/11/23/trump-picks-betsy-devos-education-secretary">Inside Higher Ed</a>, <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/What-Does-Betsy-DeVos-Have-in/238514">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/betsy-devos-trumps-education-pick-has-steered-money-from-public-schools.html">The New York Times</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/11/30/civil-rights-groups-wary-on-federal-enforcement.html">Via Education Week</a>: &#8220;The prospect that the incoming Trump administration could scale back the federal role in <strong>civil rights</strong> enforcement in education has many rights advocates deeply worried after nearly eight years of high-profile attention to such issues under President Barack Obama.&#8221; Important to watch, particularly under a Secretary of Education like Betsy DeVos.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/11/23/election-unions-teachers-clinton-trump/94242722/">Via The USA Today</a>: &#8220;About one in five <strong>American Federation of Teachers</strong> (AFT) members who cast a ballot <strong>voted for Trump</strong>, the union's leader estimated.

<p>I&#8217;m including this here mostly because it&#8217;s worth noting that, when published, <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/activists-urge-hillary-clinton-to-challenge-election-results.html">the headline describing the questions</a> about the <strong>election</strong> raised by computer science professor <strong>Alex Halderman</strong> said &#8220;activists.&#8221; Now it reads &#8220;experts.&#8221; I think the two have become conflated in frightening ways.</p>
