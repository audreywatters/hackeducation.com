The House&#8217;s version, &#8220;the Student Success Act&#8221; passed last week, so it&#8217;s on to committee. &#8220;<a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/7/15/8970605/every-child-achieves-act-no-child-left-behind">The Senate&#8217;s plan to replace No Child Left Behind, explained</a>.&#8221; A related explainer also from Vox&#8217;s Libby Nelson: &#8220;<a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/7/16/8982409/republicans-teachers-unions">The bizarre alliance between Republicans and teachers unions, explained</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wisconsin governor (and presidential candidate) Scott Walker signed a budget bill this week that, among other things, weakened tenure protections for professors at the state&#8217;s public universities. (More via <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/scott-walker-college-professor-tenure-120009.html">Politico</a> and <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/07/13/wisconsin-higher-ed-changes-are-now-law">Inside Higher Ed</a>.)

<h3>Data and &#8220;Research&#8221;</h3>
<br />
<p>It&#8217;s always depressing and a little embarrassing to read what tech investors think about education. Here&#8217;s Edsurge with &#8220;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-07-17-5-questions-with-mark-cuban-on-higher-education-and-his-newest-edtech-investment">5 Questions With Mark Cuban on Higher Education and His Newest Edtech Investment</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/231543/">Via The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>: &#8220;The American Psychological Association gave psychologists involved in the often-brutal interrogation of detainees at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere a free pass. The association tweaked its ethics code for the convenience of the U.S. military. For years it failed to investigate serious complaints of unethical conduct &#8211; and when it did investigate, its efforts were laughable.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the Pew Research Center: &#8220;<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/16/parents-and-social-media/">Parents and Social Media</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to a study from the Rennie Center for Education Research and Policy (<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/07/college-classes-for-high-school-students/398522/">as reported in The Atlantic</a>), &#8220;dual-enrollment programs, where students take classes simultaneously in high school and at a local college, have proven especially successful at getting less-affluent and first-generation students into college &#8211; and through it.&#8221;</p>
