<p><a href="http://anthologize.org/">Anthologize</a> was designed and built as part of the <a href="http://oneweekonetool.org/">One Week One Tool</a> workshop, held last week at the the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/">Center for History and New Media</a> at George Mason University.</p>
<p>The open source tool works with WordPress to transform blog content into formats accessible with e-readers.  This WordPress plugin could be a great tool for turning classroom blogs into other sorts of publications.</p>
