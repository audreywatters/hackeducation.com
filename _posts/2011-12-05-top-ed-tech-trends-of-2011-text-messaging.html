<p><em>Part 3 in my "<a href="http://2011trends.hackeducation.com">Top 10 Ed-Tech Trends of 2011</a>" series.</em></p>

<p>As I've planned this series of year-end posts, I've tried to approach the ed-tech trends of 2011 from a 30,000 foot view.  In other words, rather than looking at too many specific companies or specific events or dwelling on the minutiae of the ed-tech sector, I want to outline some of the larger patterns that I've observed over the course of the last twelve months.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, pointing to text-messaging as a major trend seems to runs counter to that.</p>

<h3>Mobile Learning</h3>
<br />
<p>Text-messaging could easily fall under the larger "mobile learning" category.  After all, early in the year, the <a href="http://www.nmc.org/pdf/2011-Horizon-Report.pdf">Horizon Report</a> pegged mobile learning as something with imminent adoption. 2011 did seem like a transformational year for the adoption of mobile devices, among students and at schools -- and not just because of the iPad (<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/01/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2011-the-ipad">trend number 1</a> in my series).  It's because of the iPod Touch.  It's because of the cellphone.</p>

<h3>BYOD</h3>
<p>Ah, the cellphone. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/09/cell-phones-in-classrooms-no-students-need-to-pay-attention264.html">The hand-wringing</a>.  Students bring them to school anyway, you know.  They have them in their backpacks, their pockets.</p>
