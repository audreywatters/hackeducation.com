<p>I&#8217;m trying to keep better track of <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/02/05/whos-investing-in-ed-tech/">who&#8217;s investing in education technology startups</a> this year &#8211; if nothing else, it&#8217;ll make it easier to write <a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com">my year-in-review series</a>, come December. Lots of other publications do the same, but their reports often cost money; and I want the data to not only be openly available, but also fully crunchable. (My battle against the PDF continues.)</p>

<p>As we&#8217;ve reached April, I&#8217;ve updated my spreadsheet with investment and acquisition data from the first quarter of 2015. This is also available in <a href="https://github.com/HackEducation/Ed-Tech-Matrix/tree/gh-pages/data">JSON</a>. (If you find any errors or omissions, please submit a pull request or file an issue on <a href="https://github.com/HackEducation/Ed-Tech-Matrix">the GitHub repo</a>).</p>

<li>Genshuixue ($50,000,000)</li>
</ol>

<p>(Some of the) Biggest Acquisitions Q1:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rakuten&#8217;s acquisition of Overdrive ($410,000,000)</li>
<li>Pluralsight&#8217;s acquisition of Code School ($36,000,000)</li>
<li>Terms for almost all the acquisitions were &#8220;undisclosed&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p>(Some of the) Most Active Investors Q1:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kapor Capital</li>
<li>500 Startups</li>
<li>Great Oaks Ventures</li>
<li>NewSchools Venture Fund</li>
</ol>

<p>A couple of other observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s tricky to decide &#8220;what counts&#8221; as an education technology startup. Social Finance, for example, which offers private student loans, doesn&#8217;t make Ambient Insight&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ambientinsight.com/Resources/Documents/AmbientInsight_2015_Q1_Global_Edtech_InvestmentPatterns.pdf">list</a> of ed-tech investments this quarter. SoFi raised $200,000,000, which makes it the biggest investment according to my figures; Lynda.com is, according to Ambient Insight. I&#8217;m not sure if FiftyThree made Ambient Insight&#8217;s list either. The company raised $30,000,000 this quarter so that it could enter the education market.</li>
<li>According to the data tracked by Ambient Insight, &#8220;in the first quarter of 2015, $451.7 million went to learning technology companies operating in China; this was 40% of the total investment that went to companies around the globe.&#8221; I need to track more closely on this, as I missed tracking on most of these big funding rounds. (Once I find out investment details, I&#8217;ll add them to my spreadsheet.) But on my list too, 3 of the top 5 funding rounds went to Chinese education technology companies.</li>
<li>Roughly half the investment rounds (34) this quarter fell between $1,000,000 and $9,000,000. 11 were between $500,000 and $999,999.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s interesting to see who&#8217;s <em>not</em> investing in education (or at least, which of the big name venture funds didn&#8217;t make any ed-tech investments this past quarter).</li>
<li>Some of the most popular areas for ed-tech investment this quarter: (corporate) skills training, career planning, language learning.</li>
</ul>
