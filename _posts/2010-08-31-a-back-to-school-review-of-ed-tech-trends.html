<p>The <a href="http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/">Horizon Report</a> is an annual publication produced by the <a href="http://www.nmc.org/">New Media Consortium</a> and the <a href="http://www.educause.edu/eli">EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative</a>. The report looks at the emerging trends in education technology, as well as some of the challenges that new technologies face.</p>
<p>The report is issued at the beginning of the year, so the trends in the 2010 report are almost nin months old. Nonetheless, it seems like back-to-school makes it a good time to revisit how far along these tech tools are in being adopted in K-12 and university classrooms.</p>
<p>Here are the four trends in teaching and learning that the Horizon Report identifies (and that it argues will shape education technology):</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The abundance of resources and relationships made easily accessible via the Internet is increasingly challenging us to revisit our roles as educators in sense-making, coaching, and credentialing.</li>
<li>People expect to be able to work, learn, and study whenever and wherever they want to.</li>
<li>The technologies we use are increasingly cloud-based, and our notions of IT support are decentralized.</li>
<li>The work of students is increasingly seen as collaborative by nature, and there is more cross-campus collaboration between departments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The technologies identified by the Horizon Report, along with a prediction of when they'll hit mainstream, are:</p>
<p><strong>1 Year or Less: </strong> Mobile Computing Open Content</p>
<p><strong>2 to 3 Years: </strong> Electronic Books Simple Augmented Reality</p>
<p><strong>4 to 5 Years: </strong> Gesture-Based Computing Visual Data Analysis</p>
<p>This is the point where my immersion in the tech world and not in the classroom makes me a terrible arbiter of what's accepted, what's "mainstream."  I work with people who are terribly giddy about AR apps, for example.  But from what I gather from educators I talk to, I still see resistance in some circles to the acceptance of mobile computing, particularly if you're talking about something like student cellphones.</p>
<p>I'd be curious to hear from educators their assessments of how accurate Horizon Report predictions seem to be.</p>
