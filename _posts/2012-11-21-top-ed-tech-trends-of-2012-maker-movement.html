<h3>Making</h3>
<br />
<p>I attend a lot of education events &mdash; ed-tech conferences, unconferences, camps, workshops, meetups, meetings. But my favorite by a long shot has always been <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">Maker Faire</a>. You can mark your calendars now for the 2013 flagship events (May 18&ndash;19 in San Mateo and September 21&ndash;22 in New York). And/or look for one of the <a href="http://makerfaire.com/map.html">Mini Maker Faires near you</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Maker Faire, an event created by <a href="http://makezine.com/">MAKE Magazine</a> (Disclosure: I have freelanced for MAKE&rsquo;s parent company O&rsquo;Reilly Media), is a little bit science fair, a little bit hobbyist and hacker expo, and a whole lot of celebration of the DIY and &ldquo;Maker&rdquo; culture. (There were plenty of other science fairs this year &mdash; including ones at the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/02/07/president-obama-hosts-white-house-science-fair">White House</a> and at <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/events/sciencefair/index.html">Google</a> &mdash; but Maker Faire is fairly unique, I&rsquo;d argue, in its culture, creativity, and community.)</p>
