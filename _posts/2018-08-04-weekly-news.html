<p><em>My apologies that this is a day late. Yesterday was the first day in over a year that I didn&#8217;t make a commit to GitHub (which I use to manage all my websites).

And thanks to the shining brilliance of American digital infrastructure there is no Internet yet in my new place.</em></p>

<p><em>Each week, I gather a wide variety of links to education and education technology articles. All this feeds the review I write each December on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the stories we are told</a> about the future of education.</em></p>

<p>I also hope that folks approach &#8220;<strong>precision education</strong>&#8221; with a lot more skepticism too. (See the story above about DNA testing struggling students in New Haven.) Here&#8217;s Laura Gogia with two articles on how this might work: <a href="https://googleguacamole.wordpress.com/2018/07/31/precision-education/">1</a> and <a href="https://googleguacamole.wordpress.com/2018/08/03/reconciling-competency-based-and-precision-medical-education/">2</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps this isn&#8217;t directly <em>education</em>-related, but I think it&#8217;s worth considering how talk of the &#8220;gig economy&#8221; is seeping into education-adjacent work. <strong>WeeCare</strong> has raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/weecare-raises-4-2m-to-help-parents-balance-career-and-family/">$4.2 million</a> in funding from Wavemaker Partners, Social Capital, Amplify.LA, Fuel Capital, and Fika Ventures.
