<p>There's something about headlines stirring up fear and revulsion over children's usage of technology that really annoys me.  The latest story making the rounds:  an <a href="http://www.avg.com/us-en/press-releases-news.ndi-672">AVG study</a> (yes, that's AVG the antivirus company, not AVG a child development research group) that finds children are learning to use computers before learning other life skills.</p>
<p>That distinction right there should probably give folks pause, as I'd contend, at least, that a familiarity with technology is surely becoming a life skill in its own right.</p>
<p>But the AVG study goes on to cite a number of activities that preschool age children aren't doing, implying by way of contrast, that preschoolers are on computers instead. (Gasp!)</p>
<p>Kids these days can use a mouse before they can learn to tie their shoes or ride a bike.  The latter insight is being bandied about as some sort of sign we're raising a generation of square-eyed robots who never venture outside to play (unless of course, they can carry their iPads with them).</p>
<p>The AVG survey does contain some interesting data, don't get me wrong.  25% of children age 2 to 5 can open a web browser.  44% of 2 to 3 year olds know how to play a computer game.  European preschoolers are more apt than U.S. preschoolers to know how to make a cellphone call.  <strong>At this age, there is no gender division between boys and girls in their technology skills</strong>.</p>
<p>What bothers me about the study, however, is how these online activities are juxtaposed to those offline.  Playing a computer game versus being able to swim.  Using a smart-phone app versus riding a bike.  Making a cellphone call versus tying your shoes.</p>
<p>I'm suspicious, perhaps, because my life skills at age 2 to 5 only <em>just</em> included how to tie my shoes.  And honestly, I think I might've been 6 before I learned how to ride my bike.  So when AVG says that small children today are more likely to navigate with a mouse, play a computer game and increasingly - operate a smart-phone - than swim, tie their shoelaces or make their own breakfast, I laugh.  I'm actually quite thrilled to think that a preschooler would have access to technology because, yes, when you're 4, you're pretty damn incompetent -- you can't ride your bike or wipe your butt or read.  You might not be able to read yet.  But you <em>can</em> play.  And you can play with technology.  If you learn at age 4 how to use a mouse, does that preclude your learning at age 4 1/2 to swim?  Seriously?</p>
<p>I really don't think these changing skills are cause for panic.  If anything, they should serve as a reason to teach kids the same sorts of safety measures we'd demand they understand before they hopped on a bike or jumped into a swimming pool.</p>
