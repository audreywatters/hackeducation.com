<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> is one of my favorite resources for finding good tech stories. It's run by <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>, the premier startup incubator program, and the site allows anyone to submit tech-related stories - vote them up and down, offer comments.  It may well be <em>the</em> site for sharing and crowdsourcing tech industry news and tech-oriented blogs.</p>
<p>I've long wished the edtech community had a better place to do just that:  share news and links, aggregate and support all the great resources that are out there.</p>
<p>And now we do, thanks to the online <a href="http://www.learnboost.com">gradebook</a> LearnBoost, who've taken the Hacker News model and applied it to the education technology space.</p>
<p>Submit your stories.  Vote and comment on the posts you like.  And subscribe to the <a href="http://news.learnboost.com/.atom">RSS feed</a>, so that you can easily track what's trending in education technology.</p>
