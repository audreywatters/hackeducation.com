<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Happy 2012. After writing a blog series outlining some of the&nbsp;</span><a href="/2011/12/16/top-10-ed-tech-trends-of-2011/">major ed-tech trends of 2011</a><span>&nbsp;as well as a few obligatory posts with&nbsp;</span><a href="/2012/01/02/robot-graders-and-other-ed-tech-predictions-for-2012/">predictions for the new year</a><span>, I figured I&rsquo;d be off to the races, energized about my work as an education technology writer, excited for the potential for better teaching and learning opportunities facilitated by technology. But so far &mdash; and yes, I realize it&rsquo;s only January 4 &mdash; it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a terribly happy new year to me. There have been a string of ed-tech-related news stories over the last 4 days that have left me frustrated, if not depressed, about the year ahead.</span></p>
