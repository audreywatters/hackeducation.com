<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This post first appeared on <a href="http://modernlearners.com/teaching-and-learning-in-the-midst-of-crisis/">Educating Modern Learners</a></em></p>
<h2>The Growing Global Refugee Crisis</h2>
<p>Last month, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/53a155bc6.html">reported</a> that "the number of refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced  people worldwide has, for the first time in the post-World War II era,  exceeded 50 million people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The number is up 6 million from the  previous year, in part because of ongoing conflicts in Syria, the  Central African Republic, and South Sudan.</p>
<p>The UNHCR puts the  number of refugees at 16.7 million people worldwide (a figure that it  admits is very difficult to calculate).&nbsp;11.7 million of those refugees  fall&nbsp;under its mandate; the other 5 million&nbsp;refugees are Palestinians  registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).</p>
<p>It is the highest number of refugees that the agency has seen in over a decade.</p>
<p>Half of these refugees are children.</p>
<h2>Education: A Basic Human Right</h2>
<p>The UNHCR <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646cda.html">writes</a> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In  the midst of conflict, education is often seen as a luxury for refugees  or internally displaced people who are also struggling to find food,  aid and shelter. But education is a basic right, one that is vital in  restoring hope and dignity to people driven from their homes. It helps  them to get back on their feet and build a better future.</em></p>
<p><em>It  is the refugees with an education, above all, who provide leadership  during displacement and in rebuilding communities recovering from  conflict. The future security of individuals and societies is  inextricably connected to the transferable skills, knowledge and  capacities that are developed through education."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the actual numbers are hard to track, but the UN <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/4a1d5ba36.html">estimates</a> about a third of refugee children are in UNHCR-supported schools &mdash;  perhaps 40% attend some kind of school. About 40% of refugee girls  attend school.</p>
<p>The challenges that face efforts to offer refugee  education are immense: almost all aspects of healthy child development &mdash;  emotional, physical, mental &mdash; are gravely threatened by refugee  situations (and of course the situations that led up the displacement).</p>
<p>But  as the UNHCR points out, "Restoration of schooling brings the widely  recognized benefits of schooling as such, including its contribution to  productivity and economic development. It can contribute to social  stability through engaging young people in sustained constructive  activity. There are also long-term implications for social cohesion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  organization's guidelines emphasize that schooling should be both  &ldquo;community-based&rdquo; and &ldquo;capacity-building." It should involve support for  training teachers and training community members to manage schools.  Many relief agencies encourage &ldquo;education for repatriation,&rdquo; meaning  that students are prepared to re-enter schools in their home origins.  Some students are taught in their own language and with curriculum that  suits their particular beliefs and that matches what they would  otherwise be learning; but depending on their chances for repatriation,  they are taught the language of the country they reside in as well.</p>
<h2>Ed-Tech and Refugee Education</h2>
<p>A  refugee camp is probably not the first place one would associate with  computers, let alone Internet access. The emphasis on meeting refugees&rsquo;  basic needs tends to draw attention away from supporting activities that  are often out-of-teach financially, technologically, practically.</p>
<p>Nevertheless  computer access is becoming something that is increasingly central to  full participation politically and economically; and some refugee camps  are offering their versions of the "Internet caf&eacute;&rdquo; to provide access to  information and sometimes even to employment. Computers are increasingly  showing up in camps for education and job training purposes &mdash;  education, that is, both <em>about</em> computers and <em>via</em> computers.</p>
<p>One NGO, for example, <a href="http://blog.unicef.ie/2014/06/learning-to-code-in-a-refugee-camp/">is using</a> the cheap Raspberry Pi microcomputers in the Syrian refugee camps in  Lebanon. The Raspberry Pis are small, lightweight and inexpensive  credit-card-sized computers. With this program, the computers are loaded  with a "core curriculum," but they <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/26/syria-children-learn-to-code-raspberry-pi">also contain</a> the popular programming language Scratch so students can build games and animations.</p>
<p>And Coursera recently <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/79379451739/guest-post-a-learning-hub-in-a-refugee-camp">boasted</a> that one of its MOOCs was offered via a learning hub in&nbsp;Dadaab, the  world&rsquo;s largest refugee camp, located on the border of Somalia. (There  are over <a href="https://data.unhcr.org/horn-of-africa/region.php?id=3&amp;country=110">340,000 refugees</a> in the camp.) Two adult members at the refugee camp were able to  successfully complete the&nbsp;&ldquo;Foundations of Teaching and Learning&rdquo; course.</p>
<p>But  as&nbsp;Barbara Moser-Mercer, professor in the Interpreting Department at  the University of Geneva and on-the-ground facilitator for the men&rsquo;s  participation in the MOOCs, points out in <a href="http://redasadki.me/2014/02/12/interview-with-barbara-moser-mercer-the-lady-who-did-moocs-in-a-refugee-camp/">a video interview</a>,  this took a lot of effort and coordination. She had to obtain  Coursera&rsquo;s permission to put the video lectures and quizzes on a USB  stick, for example. And Coursera requires that students who want  certification work with webcams always on; that&rsquo;s a challenge with  spotty Internet connectivity, but that certification was a key draw for  both students in terms of their future job opportunities. And so  Moser-Mercer devised a work-around.</p>
<p>In other words, the success  didn't come from simply piping in online coursework to a refugee camp;  it meant adapting technologies and translating content and having a  strong advocate who could offer leadership and leverage local and  international resources.</p>
<h2>The Dangers of "Technological Solutionism&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In his book <em>To Save Everything, Click Here</em>,  Evgeny Morozov cautions against what he describes as &ldquo;technological  solutionism,&rdquo; a tendency he ascribes to Silicon Valley in particular to  ignore the deep, structural causes of problems and to instead look to  quick technological fixes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Recasting all complex  social situations either as neatly defined problems with definite,  computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that  can be easily optimized&mdash;if only the right algorithms are in place!&mdash;this  quest is likely to have unexpected consequences that could eventually  cause more damage than the problems they seek to address.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take,  for example, the push for everyone to &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; as framed by many  within the tech industry. Out of work? Learn to code. <a href="https://medium.com/@aggimagine/updated-finding-the-unjustly-homeless-and-teaching-them-to-code-fee8f3ee97a0">Homeless</a>? Learn to code. Education technologies, framed this way, are poised to &ldquo;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-blake/can-moocs-cure-homelessne_b_4117990.html">cure</a>&rdquo; all societies&rsquo; problems.</p>
<p>Such  claims are at best naive, and at worst dangerously paternalistic (and  Morozov argues, even anti-democratic). And while some technology  organizations have made sweeping claims they are "democratizing  education," it isn't remotely that simple.</p>
<p>Of course new technologies <em>do</em> change how information can be accessed, but we cannot confuse access to <em>information </em>with access to <em>education</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore despite the phenomenal growth of mobile technologies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_telephony_in_Africa">throughout the world</a>,  oftentimes Internet access is still painfully slow if available at all.  &nbsp;In response, organizations like Khan Academy have worked to make their  content <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/92849748540/ka-lite-update-khan-academy-reaches-beyond-the">available</a> to communities that do not have sufficient Internet access. Volunteers  have worked to translate these materials into multiple languages and to  adapt them to local needs and constraints. (This is, of course, one of  the great benefits of using free and openly-licensed materials like Khan  Academy. You can download, adapt, and remix without permission.)</p>
<h2>Teaching and Learning in the Midst of Crisis</h2>
<p>There are many lessons here, and as Melinda Anderson's <a href="https://modernlearners.com/helping-homeless-students/">recent article on homeless students argues</a>,  these crisis situations -- at home or around the globe -- are something  that we need to address when we talk about "the future of education."</p>
<p><em>What  does teaching and learning look like for children &mdash; for communities &mdash;  in crisis? How do we identify and support leaders from within these  communities?<br /> </em></p>
<p><em>How do we ensure that learners' basic  needs are met? How do we build schools and communities that not only  address "educational outcomes" but that support students in all aspects  of their lives?</em></p>
<p><em>How do we make sure that the educational  opportunities that students are given are culturally and economically  relevant and meaningful? But how do we make sure that, in doing so, we  do not simply reinscribe or exacerbate existing inequalities?</em></p>
