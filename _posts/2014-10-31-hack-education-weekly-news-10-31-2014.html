<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Education</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/new-federal-standard-for-aid-to-for-profit-colleges-draws-criticism.html">released</a> the latest version of its &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/federal-rule-would-cut-funding-to-some-career-training-programs.html"><strong>gainful employment</strong></a>&rdquo; rules this week, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/obama-for-profit-colleges-crackdown-112340.html">pleasing nobody</a>. <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/149711/">No longer</a> will career training programs be held accountable for their student loan default rates. They&rsquo;ll just be judged on graduates&rsquo; debt-to-earnings ratios. <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/10/30/final-gainful-employment-rules-drop-loan-default-rate">About 1400 programs</a>, mostly at <strong>for-profit schools</strong>, will be affected, meaning that if they don't meet these new guidelines, their students will not be eligible for federal<strong> financial aid.</strong> (More on this over on <a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-31/">Educating Modern Learners</a>.

<p>It looks as though Ramon Cortines, the interim superintendent of <strong>LAUSD</strong>, is going to <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2014/10/27/17461/with-deasy-out-is-la-schools-ipad-program-dead/">make some changes</a> to the district&rsquo;s infamous <strong>iPad</strong> initiative. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to like the idea of spending construction bond money on the project, for starters. Meanwhile, it looks like students might actually be able to take their iPads home. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-ipads-home-20141025-story.html">Soon</a>.</p>
<p>Because of problems <strong>LAUSD</strong> has experienced with its new <strong>student information system</strong>, Cortines has ordered a review of all senior transcripts. &ldquo;To aid with transcript reviews, the district will temporarily hire 25 to 50 retired counselors and administrators at an estimated cost of $15,000 to $25,000 a day,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-student-data-20141028-story.html">reports The LA Times</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>LAUSD</strong> school board will <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/lausd-board-to-vote-on-ethnic-studies-course-for-graduation/">vote</a> next month on whether or not to make <strong>ethnic studies</strong> a required course for high school graduation.</p>
<p>A panel appointed by <strong>New York</strong> Governor Andrew Cuomo says the state <a href="http://ny.chalkbeat.org/2014/10/27/gov-cuomos-commission-on-ed-tech-spending-recommends-more-online-learning/#.VE6l2fnF-FA">should push</a> for more <strong>K&ndash;12 online education</strong>. On the three-person panel, <strong>Google</strong>&rsquo;s chairman Eric Schmidt, so I&rsquo;m shocked &ndash; shocked! &ndash; that &ldquo;moar technology!&rdquo; is the recommendation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A coalition of 22 organizations is opposing the reclassification of about 1,500 schools and libraries that have been considered &lsquo;rural&rsquo; into a category called &lsquo;urban clusters&rsquo; under changes to the Federal Communication Commission&rsquo;s <strong>E-rate</strong> program&mdash;changes that will go into effect in the 2015&ndash;16 school year,&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/10/many_rural_schools_libraries_could_lose_funds_under_new_e-rate_reform.html">reports EdWeek</a>. These reclassified institutions stand to lose a significant amount of funding.</p>
<p>The state of <strong>Wisconsin</strong> is <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/media-center/2014-news-releases/october-27-2014">suing</a> the for-profit chain <strong>Corinthian Colleges</strong>, charging it has engaged in &ldquo;unfair, false, misleading, and deceptive trade practices.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong> donated some <strong>iPads</strong> in support of President Obama&rsquo;s ConnectED initiative, so hey, that was good for PR in <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/10/apple_to_donate_ipads_to_thousands_of_students_for_connected_program.html">EdWeek</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/27/apple-connected-program/">Techcrunch</a>, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-10-27-where-apple-s-100m-connected-commitments-are-going">Edsurge</a>, etc.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been &ldquo;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Dramatic-testimony-shakes-up-City-College-of-San-5854492.php">dramatic testimony</a>&rdquo; in the trial over &ldquo;whether the <strong>Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges</strong> broke the law when evaluating <strong>City College</strong> in 2012 and 2013 before voting to revoke its accreditation.&rdquo; (Here, &ldquo;dramatic testimony&rdquo; means that the president of the commission admits that she edited out favorable language about the CCSF.)</p>
<p><strong>Stanford University</strong> and <strong>Dartmouth College</strong> <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/149687/">issued an apology</a> to <strong>Montana</strong> voters after a mailer they sent out about candidates on the state&rsquo;s ballot.</p>
<p>Nobel Laureate <strong>Malala Yousafzai</strong> <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=49193">says</a> she will donate $50,000 from her World Children&rsquo;s Prize to help rebuild schools in <strong>Gaza</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>United Federation of Teachers</strong> <a href="http://ny.chalkbeat.org/2014/10/28/uft-asks-court-to-toss-lawsuit-challenging-teacher-tenure/">filed a brief</a> this week, asking the court to throw out a lawsuit over <strong>teacher tenure</strong> in <strong>New York State</strong>.</p>
<p>The trial of Dante Martin <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/trial-begins-for-first-band-member-in-hazing-death-of-florida-am-drum-major.html">began this week</a>. Martin is accused of manslaughter and has been described as the ringleader in the &ldquo;hazing&rdquo; death of a fellow <strong>Florida A&amp;M University marching band</strong> member.</p>
<p>Lawyers in <strong>British Columbia</strong> have <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/lawyers+vote+down+school/10339932/story.html">voted</a> to have the provincial law society withdraw accreditation from a proposed <strong>law school</strong> at <strong>Trinity Western University</strong>. The vote came in part because of the evangelical university&rsquo;s plans to have &ldquo;staff, faculty and students sign a Community Covenant that among other tenets restricts sex to traditional marriage between a man and woman.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h2>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> might soon add <strong>video chats</strong>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/king-free-online-courses-may-soon-add-videochats-professors/">reports Wired</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way to get some money out of the lifelong-learner population, as opposed to the career builder,&rdquo; says CEO Richard Levin, who previously failed spectacularly on that front when he was the chairman of <strong>AllLearn</strong>, but that's history. MOOCs are the future. Video chats are the future.</p>
<p>Or maybe MOOCs were overhyped. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/education/edlife/demystifying-the-mooc.html"><strong>The New York Times</strong> is on it</a> (with <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com//2014/10/30/a-history-of-moocs-open-online-courses/">several articles about MOOCs</a> this week, which in no way contributes to the ongoing hype. Not at all.)</p>
<p>A student report from a <a href="http://titsandsass.com/learn-human-trafficking-from-home/"><strong>Coursera</strong> class on human trafficking</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abusive comments flourished in this unmoderated learning environment. In one case, a student who was a sex trafficking victim suggested destigmatizing victims: &ldquo;One attitude that I run into often is that trafficking survivors, sex workers, and even abuse and rape victims are somehow essentially damaged,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;It really really bothers me, because as a trafficking survivor I believe one way people can help is to acknowledge that we are whole human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be honest in real life I would [avoid] you,&rdquo; another student responded. &ldquo;In my version of life bad actions affect the person.&rdquo; Although this comment was down-voted, the instructor never responded to it and students continued to make similarly stigmatizing and abusive comments throughout the class.</p>

<p><strong>Coursera</strong> has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-10-27-coursera-hires-first-chief-marketing-officer">hired</a> a chief marketing officer, Kurt Apen, formerly with <strong>Disney</strong>.</p>
<p>The upcoming <strong>E-learning and Digital Cultures MOOC</strong> has a &ldquo;<a href="http://hub.digital.education.ed.ac.uk/2014/10/27/help-test-our-teacher-bot/">teacher bot</a>&rdquo; that is &ldquo;is programmed to automatically respond to tweets sent to the course hashtag, and designed to offer help and advice, or engage in conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/minerva-project/">A(nother) Wired article</a> on the for-profit wannabe-elite university startup <strong>Minerva</strong>. &ldquo;The entire first year at Minerva is dedicated to teaching three things and three things only: critical thinking, creative thinking, and effective communication. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s basically like brain hacking,&rsquo;&rdquo; says founder Ben Nelson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are <strong>Online Courses</strong> Democratizing Education or Killing Colleges?&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/10/28/are-online-courses-democratizing-education-or-killing-colleges/">asks The Wall Street Journal</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines">Betteridge&rsquo;s Law of Headlines</a> tells us the answer to this question is &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Meanwhile on Campus</h2>
<p><strong>UC Berkeley</strong> chancellor Nicholas Dirks is <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/10/30/berkeley-chancellor-blocks-attempt-rescind-invitation-bill-maher">shrugging off</a> a vote from the student group that picks the unversity&rsquo;s graduation speakers. The group voted to rescind the invitation to <strong>Bill Maher</strong> to address graduates in December, but Dirks says that the invitation will stand.</p>
<p>17% of female <strong>MIT</strong> undergraduates report having been sexually assaulted, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/us/rare-survey-examines-sex-assault-at-mit-.html">according to a survey</a> on sexual assault and harassment conducted by the school.</p>
<p><strong>Copenhagen University</strong> and the <strong>University of Southern Denmark</strong> <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20141015214238120">say</a> they will not admit foreign students.</p>
<p><strong>Benedictine University of Springfield</strong> will <a href="http://bryanalexander.org/2014/10/29/one-traditional-undergraduate-university-to-close/">close</a> its undergraduate program next year.</p>
<p><strong>Western Governors University</strong> <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/10/28/lessons-learned-competency-based-education">launched a website</a> about <strong>competency-based education</strong>. (I love it when launching a website makes the news.) Competency-based education is the &ldquo;Next Big Thing,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/10/28/competency-based-education-arrives-three-major-public-institutions">says this Inside Higher Ed headline</a>, and I can confirm CBE will make it onto my annual &ldquo;Top 10 Ed-Tech Trends&rdquo; list this year. So it&rsquo;s official.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/us/washington-school-shooting-claims-another-victim-gia-soriano.html">Another victim</a> from last week&rsquo;s <strong>school shooting</strong> in <strong>Washington</strong> died this week.</p>

(tl;dr: Students are getting high. Just like they were before.)</p>
<p>The father of a student at La Plata High School in <strong>Maryland</strong> was banned from campus, after the former Marine objected to a lesson his daughter was being taught on <strong>Islam</strong>. &ldquo;They are making Islam sound like its followers are peaceful,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/parenting/former-marine-gets-banned-from-daughters-school-over-101349990312.html">his wife told Yahoo Parenting</a>, clarifying that when he threatened to create a shitstorm, he meant in the media, not on school grounds. Totally peaceful.</p>
<p>For-profit <strong>Grand Canyon University</strong> is <a href="https://twitter.com/maggieseverns/status/527566259530244096">making a move</a> to become a non-profit.</p>
<h2>EBOLA!!!!</h2>
<p>Two middle school students who recently moved to the <strong>Bronx</strong> from <strong>Senegal</strong> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-bullies-beat-senegalese-boys-ebola-article-1.1989033">report</a> having been bullied, taunted by chants of "You&rsquo;re Ebola!&rdquo; (Senegal has been <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/senegal-is-declared-free-of-ebola/381608/">declared</a> Ebola-free.)</p>
<p>The Milford School District in <strong>Connecticut</strong> is being <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_EBOLA_LAWSUIT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">sued</a> by the father of Ikeoluw Opayemi, who contends that the district&rsquo;s decision to bar her from attending school over Ebola fears violates the Americans with Disabilities Act. Opayemi had visited <strong>Nigeria</strong> (which is now <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/20-october-2014/en/">Ebola-free</a>) this summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Due to travel advisories issued by the Centers for Disease Control, <strong>Murray State University</strong> has deferred any application from students in Ebola-affected West African countries until the fall of 2015,&rdquo; <a href="http://murrayledger.com/news/msu-defers-applications-from-ebola-affected-african-countries/article_885a14f8-5c00-11e4-b8be-e7cb7df6dc66.html">reports the Murray Ledger &amp; Times</a>.</p>

<h2>School Surveillance and Data Security</h2>
<p>The ACLU and EFF are <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/tennessee-school-boards-rights-violations/">accusing</a> a <strong>Tennessee</strong> school district of violating students&rsquo; rights with its new policy that &ldquo; allows school officials to search any electronic devices students bring to campus and to monitor and control what students post on social media sites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A reminder: &ldquo;<a href="http://funnymonkey.com/blog/filtering-and-surveillance-should-not-be-considered-protection">Filtering and Surveillance Should Not Be Considered Protection</a>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an <strong>equity</strong> issue. Or maybe it&rsquo;s about <strong>ethics</strong> in... oh nevermind.</p>
<p>The <strong>Lewisburg Area School District</strong> <a href="http://wnep.com/2014/10/30/security-breach-at-lewisburg-area-school-district/">revealed</a> a data breach this week &ndash; &ldquo;an internal file was accessed earlier this month, and students&rsquo; addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers were accessed.&rdquo; Local police say they have a suspect, who is a district student. Since the breach the district says it will no longer use <strong>Social Security numbers</strong>, a move that every single school really really really should follow. Good grief.</p>
<h2>Go, School Sports Team!</h2>
<p><strong>California University of Pennsylvania</strong> has called off a home game scheduled for this weekend after 5 members of its football team were <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/10/31/after-violent-incident-football-game-called">arrested</a> this week.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/10/30/registered-sex-offender-plays-football-alcorn-state">From Inside Higher Ed</a>: &ldquo;<strong>Alcorn State University</strong> has enrolled Jamil Cooks, who has become a star player on the institution&rsquo;s football team. ABC News reported that Cooks moved to Alcorn State University after he was convicted in a court martial of sexual assault while a student at the <strong>Air Force Academy</strong>, which expelled him. Last year, Alcorn State was criticized for having a transfer on its football team after being arrested on rape charges while he was on the team at <strong>Vanderbilt University</strong>. Cooks is a registered sex offender. He was recently named Alcorn State&rsquo;s male athlete of the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>University of Georgia</strong> football player Todd Gurley must <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/10/30/georgia-player-must-sit-out-4-games-selling-autographs">sit out</a> 4 games because he sold autographed memorabilia, something that&rsquo;s against NCAA rules. NCAA rules do not care if you&rsquo;ve been arrested for rape or sexual assault or domestic violence, but hell no you cannot sell your autograph. <strong>HELL NO</strong> that would be wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty-four percent of Division I athletes who entered college in 2007 graduated within six years,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/10/29/graduation-rates-athletes-hit-record-high">reports the NCAA</a>.

<p>Francis Schmidt, who teaches at <strong>Bergen Community College</strong>, will <a href="http://communitycollegespotlight.org/content/thrones-prof-wins-free-speech-case_18188/">not</a> lose his job because of a photo he took of his daughter wearing a <strong>Games of Thrones</strong> t-shirt saying &ldquo;I will take what is mine with fire &amp; blood.&rdquo; The school apparently interpreted this as a threat and in turn put him on leave, made him see a mental health counselor, then threatened him with suspension or termination.</p>
