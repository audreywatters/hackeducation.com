<p>An attempt to string together a bunch of thoughts and a handful of articles from the week:</p>
<p>Monday was Seymour Papert&rsquo;s 88th birthday. Papert, of course, is one of the most important figures in education technology &ndash; the author of <em>Mindstorms</em> (1980) and <em>The Children&rsquo;s Machine</em> (1993) and the co-creator of the educational programming language LOGO. He's one of my favorite people in the whole world and "<a href="https://youtu.be/6-dFTmdX1kU">the inventor of everything good in education</a>," as Gary Stager puts it.</p>
<p>On Monday, Melinda D. Anderson published an article in <em>The Atlantic</em> asking &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/02/will-the-push-for-coding-lead-to-technical-ghettos/471300/">Will the Push for Coding Lead to &lsquo;Technical Ghettos&rsquo;</a>?&rdquo; That is, will educational inequalities surrounding CS education mean that students of color end up in low-pay, dead-end jobs in the tech industry?</p>
<p>A few days later, <em>Edsurge</em> published its <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/research/special-reports/state-of-edtech-2016">list of ed-tech trends</a>, one of which is computer science education. In its summary of this trend, <em>Edsurge</em> dates the history of teaching computer science in K&ndash;12 to 1984, when the College Board first offered the Advanced Placement exam in the subject. No mention of Papert in the timeline. No mention of LOGO (which was developed in 1967).</p>
<p><em>This is how you rewrite education technology history</em> &ndash; and rewrite it to serve a particular narrative.</p>
<p>What does it mean to start your telling of the history of teaching computer science with an organization &ndash; the College Board &ndash; that reflects (if not perpetuates) some of the structural inequalities in schools? (That is to say: how SAT results are correlated with socioeconomic status; how the racial scoring gap on the SAT is <a href="http://www.jbhe.com/features/49_college_admissions-test.html">growing</a>; how there are socioeconomic, geographic, and racial differences in access to AP classes; how the racial scoring gap is <a href="http://www.jbhe.com/features/59_apscoringgap.html">growing</a> in AP programs.) To start the history of computer science education with the AP centers computer science education on courseware and assessments aimed at college bound students.</p>
<p>Now arguably, this means that you can tell a history of expanding access (thanks to recent industry-led computer science efforts) as more schools are starting to offer more AP. (&ldquo;Ka-ching,&rdquo; as <em>Edsurge</em> is wont to write.) But this doesn&rsquo;t get at issues of educational equity. Not remotely. The AP has not been a vehicle for that.</p>
<p>And arguably, neither has education technology. Its implementation &ndash; no surprise &ndash; has largely echoed and re-inscribed other structural and pedagogical inequalities in schools: there are class and race-based differences in who gets to use computers for inquiry and who gets to use computers for, say, test prep. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/04/08/inequalities">I&rsquo;ve written about this quite a lot</a>, hoping that those who work in and write about ed-tech pay more attention to these inequalities.</p>
<p>And so I read MDA&rsquo;s piece in <em>The Atlantic</em> with great interest (and I'm a little disappointed to see some of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2016/03/02/how-talk-coding-schools-creating-technical-ghettos-gets-wrong/81211188/">pushback</a> it's received&nbsp; &ndash; pushback that seems to misconstrue MDA's concerns).</p>
<p>See, it&rsquo;s not always clear to me what people actually mean when they say &ldquo;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/02/05/computer-science-for-lol">everyone should learn to code</a>,&rdquo; and this lack of clarity provides a huge opportunity for inequitable practices, I&rsquo;d contend, in no small part because &ldquo;coding&rdquo; is just one piece of understanding computers, computing, and computer science. And as the epithet &ldquo;code monkey&rdquo; suggests &ndash; a term used to describe an unskilled programmer who must follow someone else&rsquo;s engineering design or commands &ndash; &ldquo;coding&rdquo; is not necessarily highly valued. When we look at this alongside some of the tech industry&rsquo;s other employment practices &ndash; <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2015/10/venture-capitalists-silicon-valley-diversity">the lack of diversity</a>; <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-country-to-outsource-software-development-to-Why">a tendency to hire from elite private universities or from elite social networks</a>; <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-country-to-outsource-software-development-to-Why">outsourcing to developing countries</a>; <a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/h1-b-visa-program-creates-caste-system-for-silicon-valley/Content?oid=2181929">exploitation of the H1-B visa program</a> &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s only fair to ask lots of questions about what shape &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; efforts will take.</p>
<p>Indeed, &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; has become part of a larger trend&nbsp; &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/12/07/trends-skills">the employability narrative</a>&rdquo; &ndash; whereby education (K&ndash;12 and college) is reduced to job training. The rationale for computer science education is largely about employment or entrepreneurship, it seems. Again, this makes MDA&rsquo;s questions incredibly relevant in light of the tech sector&rsquo;s overwhelming whiteness &ndash; the overwhelming whiteness of its employees <em>and</em> its entrepreneurs. (And I think we can argue that <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/exclusion-and-exceptionality-in-the-pipeline">this is only partly a pipeline problem</a>.) MDA&rsquo;s questions are also relevant in light of the history of racial and gender bias &ndash; &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; &ndash; in vocational education.</p>
<p>Let me bring this back, full circle, to Seymour Papert, whose work in teaching about children about computers is, at its core, about <em>epistemology</em>, not about entrepreneurship or employment. Learning to program a computer, according to Papert, is a rich intellectual pursuit, a powerful way to &ldquo;think about thinking.&rdquo; It is, <a href="http://stager.tv/blog/?p=3596">as Gary Stager has written</a>, &ldquo;a liberal art &ndash; a way of having agency over an increasingly complex and technologically sophisticated world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Papert&rsquo;s book <em>The Children&rsquo;s Machine</em>: &ldquo;LOGO was fueled from the beginning by a Robin Hood vision of stealing programming from the technologically privileged (what I would in those early days in the 1960s have called the military-industrial complex) and giving it to children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who are the &ldquo;technologically privileged&rdquo; these days? And are &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; efforts part of a social justice vision, a Robin Hood-like act of stealing programming from them? Or rather, <em>which</em> computer science education efforts have equity and agency at their core, and which might be more about conscripting cheap and compliant labor for today&rsquo;s version of that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-innovation-idUSKCN0W421V">complex</a>?</p>
