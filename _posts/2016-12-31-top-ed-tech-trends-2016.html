<p>Here is a list of all the articles I wrote as part of my look at the &#8220;<a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">Top Ed-Tech Trends</a>&#8221; of the year. <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/template_writing100.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></p>

<p>&#8220;Trends&#8221; is perhaps the wrong word here. These are my observations about what&#8217;s happened in education technology (and education more broadly) over the course of the past 12 months. This project &#8211; <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/11/30/top-ed-tech-trends-review">something I&#8217;ve done every year since 2010</a> &#8211; aims to serve as an in-depth analysis of the noteworthy events and products and politics and financing and tries to piece together the narratives and ideologies that drive ed-tech.</p>
