<h3>Twitter for Edu</h3>
<br />
<p>In recent years Twitter has become a very popular tool for educators, with some calling the social media platform "<a href="http://www.edudemic.com/twitter-best-professional-development-tool-teachers/">The Best Professional Development Tool for Teachers</a>&rdquo; and some claiming that educators &ldquo;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-04-30-twitter-exec-reports-that-educators-dominate-the-twitter-sphere">dominate</a>&rdquo;  Twitter. (The math doesn&rsquo;t really work out on the last claim. By  Twitter&rsquo;s own calculations, less than 1% of tweets are  education-related.)</p>
<p>Regardless of what percentage of Twitter is  comprised by educators, on any given night of the week, there are  usually several regularly-scheduled "<a href="http://www.teachthought.com/twitter-hashtags-for-teacher/">Twitter chats</a>,&rdquo;  where educators engage in hosted and topical conversations. These can  be followed by monitoring the associated hashtag (that is, a word or  phrase preceded by the pound sign #), and appending a hashtag to a tweet  is always a good way for it to be seen outside of one&rsquo;s followers.</p>
<p>Twitter can be overwhelming, particularly for new users &mdash; some 350,000 tweets are sent <a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/">every minute</a> &mdash; and arguably hashtags do make it easier to follow a particular  conversation. But Twitter chats can still be noisy and difficult to  follow. Tweets rush by in real-time (that&rsquo;s a core feature of the  Twitter service) even if you&rsquo;re using a client like Tweetdeck or  Hootsuite that lets you devote a column to a certain hashtag (as opposed  to viewing your entire Twitter stream).</p>
<p>Nevertheless,  many have argued that Twitter has become one of the most important  tools for them to be &ldquo;connected educators.&rdquo; Twitter allows educators to  share their ideas and practices with one another, and to build  professional networks that are supportive and generative.</p>
<p>Ideally.</p>
<h3>Twitter Has Changed</h3>
<br />
<p>There have been growing concerns over recent months that &ldquo;Twitter has changed.&rdquo; The Atlantic published a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/a-eulogy-for-twitter/361339/">Eulogy for Twitter</a>&rdquo; back in April. And even Bonnie Stewart, whose dissertation is exploring the academic use of social media, recently <a href="http://theory.cribchronicles.com/2014/09/02/something-is-rotten-in-the-state-of-twitter/">wrote</a> that &ldquo;something is rotten in the state of Twitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some  of what&rsquo;s &ldquo;rotten" stems from changes (both proposed and enacted) to  the Twitter platform itself. Twitter is increasingly focused on  monetization efforts, for example, and there have been rumors too that  the company might explore delivering the Twitter stream algorithmically  rather than in the unaltered &ldquo;firehose&rdquo; as it does currently.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s  been a key element of Twitter that distinguishes it from Facebook,  which organizes the News Feed algorithmically &mdash; organizing and  displaying (or not displaying) certain posts, arguably those that  encourage the most &ldquo;engagement.&rdquo; While Twitter has become an important  journalistic tool, in part because of the real-time nature of updates,  Facebook has been less useful in this way &mdash; the News Feed doesn&rsquo;t  present updates in the same chronological order, for starters. Several  media observers found striking differences in their Twitter and Facebook  feeds when it came to current events, including the <a href="https://medium.com/message/ferguson-is-also-a-net-neutrality-issue-6d2f3db51eb0">protests</a> in Ferguson, Missouri and the <a href="https://medium.com/i-data/israel-gaza-war-data-a54969aeb23e">war</a> in Gaza. What were incredibly popular and active topics for discussion on Twitter were almost entirely missing on Facebook.</p>
<h3>Twitter&rsquo;s Filter Bubbles</h3>
<br />
<p>The  concern that new technologies, despite the rhetoric around open access  to information, are going to diminish our ability to see wide-ranging  and different opinions is something that Eli Pariser explores in his  book <em><a href="http://www.thefilterbubble.com/">The Filter Bubble</a></em>.  Technology promises &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; &mdash; whether Netflix movie  recommendations, search results based on your Google browsing history,  or the updates you see on social media. But that by filtering out some  things, we might find ourselves intellectually isolated.</p>
<p>And  arguably some of that already happens on a site like Twitter where you  choose who to follow. (Twitter is experimenting with injecting tweets  into people&rsquo;s streams from people they do not follow. The experiment has  not been received well.) It&rsquo;s worth asking yourself, particularly if  you see Twitter as a tool for your own learning and professional  development, how diverse the ideas are that come across your Twitter  feed. Are you seeing a multiplicity of voices? Or have you cultivated a  bubble? (Diversity matters in a number of ways. According to a recent <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/self-segregation-why-its-hard-for-whites-to-understand-ferguson/378928/">survey</a> of Internet users, white Americans' social networks are 91% white.)</p>
<h3>Dangerous Tweets</h3>
<br />
<p>Add  to this, a number of highly publicized episodes, particularly over the  last few months, where tweets have landed educators in hot water. Steven  Salaita, for example, had his tenure-track position at the University  of Illinois Urbana Champaign <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/world/middleeast/professors-angry-tweets-on-gaza-cost-him-a-job.html">rescinded</a> after the university disproved of his tweets in support of Palestinians.</p>
<p>As  Bonnie Stewart argues, "The threat of being summarily acted upon by the  academy as a consequence of tweets&nbsp;&ndash; always present, frankly,  particularly for untenured and more vulnerable members of the academic  community &ndash; now hangs visibly over all heads&hellip;even while the medium is  still scorned as scholarship by many.&rdquo; While there are efforts to  encourage educators and students to participate in the public sphere,  via tools like Twitter, it&rsquo;s clear that there are also risks in doing  so, particularly if what&rsquo;s being said fails to conform to certain  &ldquo;community standards&rdquo; or certain notions of &ldquo;civility."</p>
<h3>Twitter: Big and Mean</h3>
<br />
<p>But  the problems with Twitter as identified by Stewart and others isn&rsquo;t  simply that Twitter&rsquo;s business decisions have skewed it towards pleasing  advertisers over users or that the platform&rsquo;s publicness has enabled  more surveillance by various supervisory bodies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense  that, in the growth of the platform, something has been lost: the  intimacy of connection and community. In short, it&rsquo;s become a  not-very-nice place.</p>
<p>As Baylor University professor Alan Jacobs has <a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2014/08/the-end-of-big-twitter.html">written</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I  have found that my greatest frustrations with Twitter come not from  people who are being nasty &mdash; though there are far too many of them &mdash; but  from people who just <em>misunderstand</em>. They reply questioningly or  challengingly to a tweet without reading any of the preceding or  succeeding tweets that would give it context, or without reading the  post that it links to. They take jokes seriously &mdash; Oh Lord do they take  jokes seriously. And far too often they don&rsquo;t take the time to formulate  their responses with care and so write tweets that I can&rsquo;t make sense  of at all. And I don&rsquo;t want to have to <em>deal</em> with all this. I just want to sit here on the porch and have a nice chat with my friends and neighbors.</p>
<br />
<p>But wait. I&rsquo;m not on the porch anymore. I&rsquo;m in the middle of Broadway."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenNews&rsquo; Erin Kissane <a href="http://incisive.nu/2014/ditching-twitter/">shares</a> a similar sentiment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A  "feeling like I&rsquo;m sitting at a sidewalk cafe, speaking in a  conversational voice, but having that voice projected so loudly that  strangers many streets away are invited to comment on my most  inconsequential statements&mdash;especially if something I say gets retweeted  beyond my usual circles. In the past, a smaller version of that  publicness has brought me wonderful friends and a job I love, but now  the stranger-replies provide a steady stream of joykills, demands for  attention, and indignantly misguided attacks mixed in with the funny  comments and helpful links. And there are the actual trolls, of course,  both lulzy and sincerely malicious, and they&rsquo;re tiring, and my  bounce-back is in shorter supply these days.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>So&hellip; Twitter for Professional Development. Is This What We Want?</h3>
<br />
<p>Can we really insist or even recommend Twitter for PD?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s  frustrating, of course, to see pronouncements of &ldquo;the death of Twitter&rdquo;  just as the platform is gaining more adoption among educators. That  just as educators are able to use Twitter to share their practices  publicly, we&rsquo;re reminded that sharing publicly is dangerous. That just  as we turn to Twitter for unfiltered, real-time news and information,  the algorithm changes. That just as we can find and amplify marginalized  voices, they&rsquo;re silenced. That just as we learn to embrace the  cacophony of voices that Twitter enables, we find that the rage and  sadness and anger in so many of those voices are more than we can bear.</p>
<p>The  response doesn't have to be &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use Twitter.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m not arguing  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use Twitter for professional development.&rdquo; But it is a reminder  that there is a fragility to our ability to connect and share online.  Some of that fragility comes when we opt to rely on for-profit companies  to run the infrastructure. We do not own the conversations on Twitter.  We have limited control over our data and the content we create and  share there.</p>
<p>Fans of Twitter (and full disclosure, I am an avid  Twitter user) have long argued that the 140 character updates was a  feature, not a bug &mdash; that short and quick status updates were a good  thing, that Twitter was flexible to make it what you wanted and to  engage with it how you wanted. But I&rsquo;m not sure any longer that that&rsquo;s  really the case. And I&rsquo;m not sure it really ever has been.</p>
<p>Despite all the pushes to "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/09/the-case-for-having-class-discussions-on-twitter/379777/">bring Twitter to the classroom</a>&rdquo; and calls to have Twitter "<a href="http://hechingered.org/content/can-twitter-replace-traditional-professional-development_5315/">replace traditional professional development</a>,&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m less and less convinced that&rsquo;s a good idea &mdash; or at least, I'm more  and more convinced that we should not rely solely on Twitter as the site  for online PD or for online educator community. Both can and do exist  online &mdash; PD and community &mdash; but I&rsquo;d wager the best place to find both  remain on educators' blogs. I wonder if, in fact, "the future of  professional development" might be a "return to blogging."</p>
