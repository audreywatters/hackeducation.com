<p><em>Each week, I gather a wide variety of links to education and education technology articles. All this feeds the review I write each December on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the stories we are told</a> about the future of education. It&#8217;s a bit tricky to do some weeks &#8211; because some weeks I&#8217;m traveling and some weeks a major event happens in the middle of the week making some of the &#8220;before&#8221; reporting seem a little odd.</em></p>
