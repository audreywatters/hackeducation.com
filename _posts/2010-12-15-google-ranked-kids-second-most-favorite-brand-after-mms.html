<p>Harris Interactive recently released the results from its first annual <a href="http://www.smartbrief.com/news/aaaa/industryPR-detail.jsp?id=2846091A-FFE0-47C8-9B06-A500577D7762">YouthEquiTrend</a> study, which asked 8-24 year olds to rate brands based on familiarity, quality, and purchase consideration.  The results are interesting for a number of reasons, least of which being where tech tools happen to fall in these lists of preferred brand-names.</p>
<h2>All Respondents</h2>
<p>1.  M&amp;Ms <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.  Google</strong></p>
<p>3.  Reese's  Peanut Butter Cups</p>
<p>4.  Oreos <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5.  iPod</strong></p>
<p>6.  Target</p>
<p>7.  Subway</p>
<p>8.  Hershey's Milk Chocolate</p>
<p>9.  Doritos</p>
<p>10.  Pixar</p>
<h2>Tweens, Age 8-12</h2>
<p><strong>1.  Nintendo Wii</strong></p>
<p>2.  Doritos</p>
<p>3.  Oreos</p>
<p>4.  M&amp;Ms</p>
<p>5.  Disney Channel</p>
<p>6.  Nickelodeon</p>
<p><strong>7.  Nintendo DS</strong></p>
<p>8.  McDonalds</p>
<p>9.  Toys R Us</p>
<p>10.  Cartoon Network</p>
<p>It's interesting to see that neither Google nor Apple make the Top 10 for this age group, although Nintendo places twice.  Also notable, the number of television stations -- something not reflected in other age brackets' choices.</p>
<h2>Teens, 13-17</h2>
<p>1.  Reese's Peanut Butter Cups <strong>2.  iPod</strong> <strong>3.  Google</strong> 4. M&amp;Ms 5. Oreos 6. Subway 7. Hershey's Milk Chocolate 8. Target 9. Sprite <strong>10. Microsoft</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft doesn't make the Top 10 for all age groups, and it barely makes the list for teens.</p>
<h2>Young Adults, 18-24</h2>
<p><strong>1.  Google 2.  Facebook 3.  iPod</strong> 4.  Gatorade 5.  Target 6.  Subway <strong>7.  Apple 8.  iTunes</strong> 9.  Reese's Peanut Butter Cups 10.  Oreos</p>
<p>Half the items on young adults' Top 10 are tech-related, with Apple nabbing three spots.  Here we see Facebook make its first appearance on the list, even though anyone over 13 can join.  But in news that will make some executives in Mountain View relieved, I'm sure, young adults prefer the Google brand over Facebook and Apple.</p>
