<p><a title="Fail at writing by h3_six, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hach3/2606380637/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2129/2606380637_51aaf290f8.jpg" alt="Fail at writing" width="500" height="429" /></a></p>
<p>Earlier this year, I applied for the <a href="http://spencer.jrn.columbia.edu/">Spencer Education Journalism Fellowship</a> at Columbia University.  The year-long fellowship provides three education journalists with a stipend to spend the year at the school, working with professors in the education and journalism department and working on a long-form writing project on the subject of the U.S. public education system.</p>
<p>I learned this week that I didn't receive the fellowship.  I'm not terribly disappointed nor am I particularly surprised, particularly as word on the street is that the three who did are capital-J-Journalists working for the capital-M-Media.</p>
<p>What would be more disappointing for me, I suppose, is if I didn't figure out a way to work on the project that I proposed:  a deep dive into the technology and the politics of educational data and learning analytics, particularly when it comes to the adoption and usage of adaptive learning software in K-12 education.</p>
<p>I've posted my proposal <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lM9LvJ8J_5nICUUs7tRpNOOSdoTlu7EZNMubkacxekg/edit">online</a>, and I welcome your feedback -- although truthfully (and maybe disappointedly), I probably will now put that idea on the backburner while I move forward with several others projects, which [IN YOUR FACE, COLUMBIA!] will be incredibly awesome.  More news to follow...</p>
