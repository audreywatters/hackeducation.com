<p><a title="Audrey Watters Takes on The World by cogdogblog, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogdog/10295189744/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7316/10295189744_17ae03aaca.jpg" alt="Audrey Watters Takes on The World" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Yesterday, I wrapped up my year-end series on the <a href="http://hackeducation.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=ed-tech%20trends%202013">Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2013</a>. Good riddance to 2013. (Good riddance to the series.)</p>
<p>Seriously though: It&rsquo;s a project that takes me an incredibly long time to do &mdash; to review everything that&rsquo;s happened in ed-tech throughout the year and to compile an overview that captures events and offers analysis. I sometimes shudder that these posts get wrapped up in the weariness, if not animosity towards year-end &ldquo;list&rdquo; posts (<a href="http://audreywatters.com/2012/11/25/top-100-reasons-why-i-hate-list-posts/">I hate list posts too</a>) ,and I do wonder sometimes if it&rsquo;s even worth my writing annual reviews. Like I said, they&rsquo;re a ton of work.</p>
<p>But I admit, I enjoy the process, as I learn a lot and see things that I mightn&rsquo;t otherwise. (That happens when you re-read <a href="http://hackeducation.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=weekly%20roundup">each weekly news roundup</a> ten times or more in the process of composing these reviews.)</p>
<p>And I hope there&rsquo;s value here for my readers.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I&rsquo;d like to remind folks about the &ldquo;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/support.php">donate</a>&rdquo; button on this site.</p>
<p>I purposefully keep Hack Education advertising-free. And unlike many other technology blogs, Hack Education isn&rsquo;t owned by a major technology or media company. I don&rsquo;t take sponsorship dollars to promote certain posts or products. I have not taken investment money from the same venture capitalists who fund education/technology companies.&nbsp;I am an independent voice.</p>
<p>But I need to make a living.</p>
<p>So perhaps a site like this can be crowdfunded, written for the community and in turn supported by the community &mdash; perhaps a bit like NPR (but without the government subsidy clearly, or the corporate sponsorship dollars or the swag or the semi-annual fund-drives &mdash; just this <em>one</em> annual reminder).</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing here - your one annual reminder. If you are willing and able, I would very much <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support.php">appreciate your support</a>. Thank you. A huge thank you to those who&rsquo;ve donated throughout the year. You help make my work possible. And thanks to everyone who reading.</p>
