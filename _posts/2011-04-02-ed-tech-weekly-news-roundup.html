<p><em>A (snark-free) version of this round-up appears on <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/04/weekly-news-roundup-3/">MindShift</a></em></p>
<p>The VOIP service <a href="http://www.skype.com"><strong>Skype</strong></a> announced the launch of "<a href="http://education.skype.com/">Skype in the Classroom</a>," a directory to help connect educators with others who are using the service.  Skype has recognized that teachers are already using the service to connect their classrooms, and so it wanted to make it easier for teachers to find others and to share Skype lessons and resources.  I broke this story over a month ago on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/skype_in_the_classroom_launches_to_connect_teacher.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>, but go ahead, retweet the Mashable version.  See if I care.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011"><strong>Google Summer of Code</strong></a> is now open for student applications.  The program gives college students the opportunity to spend the summer doing real-world, open-source programming with mentor organizations.  These organizations include <a href="http://techblog.wikimedia.org/tag/google-summer-of-code/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Projects_for_new_developers">Moodle</a>, and many, many others.  Applications are due April 8.</p>
<p>The computational knowledge engine <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com"><strong>WolframAlpha</strong></a> has launched two more of its <a href="http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2011/03/31/wolfram-astronomy-and-multivariable-calculus-apps-come-to-ios/">Course Assistant</a> apps:  one for Astronomy and one for Multivariable Calculus.  The apps are available for iPhone, cost $4.99, and beg the question:  why on earth would you bring a calculator to class when you can bring WolframAlpha.</p>
<p>The <strong>ACLU</strong> has started a campaign, reports <a href="http://www.eschoolnews.com/2011/03/28/aclu-demands-high-schools-remove-anti-gay-filters/">eSchoolNews</a>, demanding that high schools remove filters that block access to websites that support LGBT communities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.epals.com/"><strong>ePals</strong></a>, which describes itself as "the largest K-12 learning network in the world," unveiled its Learning Pages partner program.  Learning Pages lets school communities have access to various media like educational games, podcasts, and online exhibits, as well as guided classroom activities, discussion forums, and links for teachers to collaborate on projects with other classrooms around the world. Partners as part of the launch include National Geographic, SnagFilms, and Microsoft Partners in Learning.</p>
<p><strong>Sesame Street</strong> has launched an iPad e-book reader.  The app itself is free, and books are available for subscription.  <a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/03/sesame-street-launches-subscription-based-ipad-app/">GeekDad</a>'s Daniel Donahoo points out, however, that there aren't any free copies for you to sample before you buy, but he does not that the quality of the content there is high.</p>
<p>Online test-prep company <a href="http://www.prepme.com"><strong>PrepMe</strong></a> has launched a new service called Coursification,  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/28/prepmes-coursification-offers-a-personalized-online-learning-platform/">TechCrunch</a> reports.  Man, I hate that name.  Coursification, that is.  I also hate that story in TechCrunch.  Read and see if you can figure out why.</p>
<p>Professor Dan Cohen has just released a <a href="http://www.dancohen.org/2011/03/30/a-million-syllabi">database</a> of over one million course syllabi, gathered from the Internet between 2002 and 2009.  The data is available for people to download, and via analysis and visualization, I'm guessing this data could give us some very interesting insights into changes in college instruction.  Cohen is the director for the <strong>Center for History and New Media</strong> at George Mason University.</p>
