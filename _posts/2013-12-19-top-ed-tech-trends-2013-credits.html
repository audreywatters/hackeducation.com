<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 9 of my&nbsp;<a href="http://2013trends.hackeducation.com">Top 10 Ed-Tech Trends of 2013</a>&nbsp;series</em></p>

<p>This trend is one of the few this year that I haven&rsquo;t explicitly covered in years past: what&rsquo;s happening to &ldquo;the credit&rdquo; &ndash; the credit hour, accreditation, and so on. What counts for credit?&nbsp;<em>Who</em>&nbsp;counts these alternatives? What are they worth?</p>

<p>This trend is, of course, intertwined with the&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/11/29/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-moocs">hype about MOOCs</a>&nbsp;and competency-based education, along with the ongoing concerns about the cost of higher education, the explosion in student loan debt, and the demand that &ldquo;everyone go to college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For those keeping score at home: in the Fall of 2013,&nbsp;<a href="http://nscresearchcenter.org/currenttermenrollmentestimate-fall2013/">postsecondary enrollments decreased</a>&nbsp;1.5% from 2012. Enrollments fell at four-year for-profit institutions (down 9.7%) and two-year public institutions (down 3.1%), although they did increase slightly among four-year public institutions (up 0.3%) and four-year private non-profit institutions (up 1.3%). Some of this is no doubt cyclical, as enrollments change as opportunities outside of school grow or shrink. But the&nbsp;<a href="http://communitycollegespotlight.org/content/diploma-gap-widens-between-rich-poor_12554/">diploma gap between high-income and low-income students continued to grow</a>&nbsp;(54% of students from high-income families born circa 1980 completed a college degree compared to 9% of those from low-income families). And opportunities for the college-educated and the non-college educated alike seemed circumscribed in an economy that feels pretty grim.</p>

<h3>Debt Nation</h3>
<br />
<p>The average student loan debt (that is, for those students taking loans &ndash; roughly 7 in 10) hit&nbsp;<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/04/pf/college/student-loan-debt/">$29,400</a>&nbsp;this year. (<a href="http://projectonstudentdebt.org/state_by_state-data.php">Here&rsquo;s a breakdown state-by-state</a>&nbsp;of who&rsquo;s graduating with debt.)</p>
