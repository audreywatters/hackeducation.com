But there was a flurry of funding headlines this week, which in light of other financial signals sure seemed like a panicky attempt to convince the industry that everything&#8217;s cool.</p>

<p>On the heels of its acquisitions of <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/13541937/1/hackbright-academy-joins-capella-education-company-to-further-goal-of-closing-the-gender-gap-in-software-engineering.html"><strong>Hackbright Academy</strong></a>, for-profit university <strong>Capella</strong> has bought another coding bootcamp: <strong>Dev Mountain</strong>. <a href="http://www.capellaeducation.com/investor-relations/investor-news/news-release-details/2016/Capella-Acquisition-of-DevMountain-Extends-Leadership-Position-in-Job-Ready-Skills-Market/default.aspx">According to the company press release</a>, the deal was closed at &#8220;a purchase price of up to $20 million, of which $15 million was paid in cash at closing with up to an additional $5 million to be paid over a three-year period pending the achievement of certain annual revenue and operating performance metrics.&#8221; </p>

<p>I have no idea why this would count as &#8220;ed-tech&#8221; (unless we&#8217;re just desperate to boost the investment totals for the sector), but Edsurge reports that <strong>Odyssey</strong> has raised <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-04-30-odyssey-online-publishing-platform-driven-by-college-writers-raises-25-million">$25 million</a> from Columbus Nova and Michael Lazerow. The company does aim its &#8220;social content platform&#8221; at millennials, so maybe that&#8217;s the angle. Bonus: the company has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/olympia-media-group#/entity">$33.15 million</a> total and does not pay its writers.</p>

<p><strong>Age of Learning</strong> has raised <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/03/age-of-learning-a-quiet-giant-in-education-apps-raised-150m-at-a-1b-valuation-from-iconiq/">$150 million</a> from Iconiq Capital,, the largest investment that ed-tech has seen so far this year. The company makes a very popular, but very 1990s-looking app ABCMouse. It was founded by Doug Dohring, who also founded <strong>Neopets</strong>. Age of Learning has raised about <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/age-of-learning#/entity">$180 million</a> total.</p>

<p><strong>GotIt!</strong> has raised $6.4 million in Series A funding from the Capricorn Investment Group, Plug and Play, and the TEEC Angel Fund.
