<h2>HACK(ING) SCHOOL(ING)</h2>
<p><strong><em>Another One Week, One "Book" Project</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://jonbecker.net/">Jon Becker</a> and I are pleased to announce a new project: Hacking Schooling.</p>
<p>The project and the process borrow liberally from 2010&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.digitalculture.org/hacking-the-academy/">Hacking the Academy</a>, which called for <a href="http://www.dancohen.org/2010/05/21/one-week-one-book-hacking-the-academy/">scholars</a> to consider the ways in which digital culture and digital technologies were reshaping (and/or threatening to reshape) institutions of higher education.</p>
<p>Jon and I want to look beyond &ldquo;the academy&rdquo; and turn our eye to &ldquo;the school.&rdquo; So we&rsquo;re asking for submissions to a new &ldquo;book&rdquo; with the working title Hack(ing) School(ing), which like the Hacking the Academy process, will only take submissions for one week.</p>
<p>I am &ndash; no surprise &ndash; partial to the verb &ldquo;to hack.&rdquo; To break in and break down. To cut to the core. To chop roughly. To subvert. To be mediocre (okay, let&rsquo;s ignore that definition.) To pull systems apart. To &ldquo;MacGyver&rdquo; things back together. To re-code. To rebuild.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth (re)considering too what we mean by hacking &ldquo;the academy,&rdquo; hacking &ldquo;education,&rdquo; hacking &ldquo;school&rdquo; and hacking &ldquo;schooling.&rdquo; Much like the verb &ldquo;to hack,&rdquo; these nouns (and direct objects in that particular construction) have varied meanings that are worth cracking (hacking) open, decoding, reconsidering, and rebuilding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hacking school&rdquo; means something more, I would argue, than &ldquo;adopting education technology&rdquo; &ndash; even though the hacks and hackers and hacking likely comes at the hands of new technologies, hardware, software, networks, Webs, nets, digitalia, algorithms, and applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://edinsanity.com/2012/07/10/hacking-schooling-one-week-one-book/">Read more about the project on Jon's blog Educational Insanity</a>.</p>
<h2>Submission Process</h2>
<p>Using and building upon the successes of Hacking the Academy, Hack(ing) School(ing) will be a curated, multimedia &ldquo;book.&rdquo; We invite folks to submit posts, articles, artifacts that you believe would be relevant to a collection on Hack(ing) School(ing). What this ultimately looks like is still to-be-determined; maybe it&rsquo;s more than one &ldquo;thing.&rdquo; We will ultimately let the content of the submissions dictate the structure of the collection(s). Consider, though, just the following short list of possible topic areas:</p>
<p>Hacking learning spaces (where learning happens) Hacking learning time (the school day, year) Hacking the curriculum Hacking credentialing/assessment Hacking professional development</p>
<p>So, if you have something you&rsquo;d like to submit to Hack(ing) School(ing), please click on the link below and fill out the form.</p>
<p>We will close submissions one week from today: <strong>July 17, 2012</strong>.</p>
