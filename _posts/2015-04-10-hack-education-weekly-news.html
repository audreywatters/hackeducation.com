<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>Senators Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Patty Murray (D-WA) have negotiated a <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/senators-reach-deal-on-a-bipartisan-no-child-left-behind#.wy5yzVloy">bipartisan</a> revision to ESEA. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/us/senators-propose-bipartisan-bill-to-revise-no-child-left-behind-law.html">According to The New York Times</a>, &#8220;The bill retains the requirement for yearly tests in math and reading for every student in third through eighth grade, and once in high school, and requires that the scores, broken down by race and income, be made public.&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/04/is-america-nearing-the-end-of-the-no-child-left-behind-era/390030/">Is America Nearing the End of the No Child Left Behind Era?</a>&#8221; Perhaps, if only because the name of the bill this time around is &#8220;The Every Child Achieves Act of 2015.&#8221;</p>

<p>A &#8220;discussion draft&#8221; of a revision to FERPA was <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/04/ferpa_overhaul_US_House.html">released</a> to the US House of Representatives&#8217; education committee.</p>

<p><a href="http://cbldf.org/2015/04/minnesota-legislation-would-let-parents-label-classroom-materials-harmful-to-minors/">From the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three similar bills recently introduced in the Minnesota legislature would require school districts to notify parents or guardians every time a fellow parent, guardian, or an adult student deems instructional material such as books or movies to be &#8220;sexually explicit or obscene and therefore harmful to minors.&#8221; Although the bills do not require discontinuing use of the disputed material, the most extreme version would force districts to publicly justify its retention in the curriculum. To make matters worse, all three bills would apparently allow complainants to remain anonymous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nine states attorneys general have <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/nine-states-demand-education-department-forgive-loans#.rbMeDAmMe">written a letter</a> to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, calling for loan forgiveness for Corinthian Colleges&#8217; students.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some states (<a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/04/08/398037156/states-review-laws-revoking-licenses-for-student-loan-defaults">like Montana</a>) are looking at revoking the driver&#8217;s licenses and other professional licenses from students who default on their student loans. Because <em>that&#8217;s</em> going to help them pay the money back.</p>

<p>Timed with the ASU-GSV Summit, the Department of Education released an <a href="http://tech.ed.gov/developers-guide/">ed-tech developers guide</a> this week. (<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-04-07-advice-for-edtech-entrepreneurs-from-arne-duncan">Here&#8217;s Edsurge&#8217;s coverage</a>.) Justin Reich&#8217;s <a href="http://www.edtechresearcher.com/2015/04/preface-for-the-edtech-developers-guide/">alt-preface</a> is much better than the department&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The Texas legislature is <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0415/morningeducation17776.html">debating a bill</a> that would repeal in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>Via Vox: &#8220;<a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/4/7/8356979/rand-paul-education-department">Rand Paul wants to close the Education Department. Here&#8217;s how that would work</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p>The Marshall Project&#8217;s Dana Goldstein <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/04/09/cheaters-never-prosper">compares</a> the convictions and (possible 20 year) sentences of the Atlanta educators to others accused/convicted of tampering with students&#8217; standardized tests. (Spoiler alert: cheaters &#8220;hardly ever get punished this severely.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Consumer groups have filed a complaint with the FTC over the YouTube Kids app, &#8220;claiming it misleads parents and violates rules on &#8216;unfair and deceptive marketing&#8217; for kids.&#8221; <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/exposing-murky-world-online-ads-aimed-kids/">More via Wired</a>.</p>

<p>Johns Hopkins is facing a <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/johns-hopkins-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-over-u-s-experiments-in-guatemala/96601">$1 billion lawsuit</a> &#8220;its role in U.S.-government experiments in Guatemala in the 1940s that infected hundreds of people with sexually transmitted diseases.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/04/09/virginia-attorney-general-weighs-in-on-sweet-briar-college-case/">Virginia&#8217;s Attorney General weighed in</a> this week to say that Ellen Bowyer, the Amherst County attorney, does not have the legal authority to challenge Sweet Briar College&#8217;s closing.</p>

<p>The New York Attorney General is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/business/cooper-union-inquiry-puts-nonprofits-on-notice.html">investigating</a> board of Cooper Union, which announced last year that it would charge tuition for the first time in its history &#8211; its &#8220;management of its endowment; its handling of its major asset, the Chrysler Building; its dealings with Tishman Speyer Properties, which manages the skyscraper; and how it obtained a $175 million loan from MetLife using the building as collateral.&#8221;</p>

<p>GeekDad has <a href="http://geekdad.com/2015/04/geekdad-settles-a-legal-matter/">settled its legal issues</a> with Condé Nast, which in a huge jerk move tried to retain control of the GeekDad brand even though it started long before the blog moved under the Wired domain. The GeekDad folks are having to pay to keep their name. </p>

<h3>Testing, Testing&#8230; (Privacy, InfoSec, and Edu Data)</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/technology/online-test-takers-feel-anti-cheating-softwares-uneasy-glare.html">The New York Times&#8217; Natasha Singer looks at</a> the controversy at Rutgers over ProctorTrack, an &#8220;anti-cheating&#8221; online testing platform.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You have to put your face up to it and you put your knuckles up to it,&#8221; Ms. Chao said recently, explaining how the program uses webcams to scan students&#8217; features and verify their identities before the test.</p>
<br />
<p>Once her exam started, Ms. Chao said, a red warning band appeared on the computer screen indicating that Proctortrack was monitoring her computer and recording video of her. To constantly remind her that she was being watched, the program also showed a live image of her in miniature on her screen.</p>
<br />
<p>&#8230;Proctortrack uses algorithms to detect unusual student behavior &#8211; like talking to someone off-screen &#8211; that could constitute cheating. Then it categorizes each student as having high or low &#8216;integrity.&#8217;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20150408-staar-is-all-over-social-media-but-texas-isnt-too-concerned.ece">According to the Dallas News</a>, Texas officials are not too concerned about students&#8217; STAAR-related tweets.</p>

<p>The Tewksbury Public School District in Massachusetts <a href="http://homenewshere.com/tewksbury_town_crier/news/article_6222c6dc-da0d-11e4-972f-bf171ca1b609.html">published</a> private student information online last week &#8211; specifically, &#8220;information for the out of district placements of 83 students [which] rates their parents according to their &#8216;cooperativeness&#8217; with the district.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/refusethetestsrobocall/fundraiser/debescobar">A crowdfunding campaign</a> to robocall all New York parents, urging them to opt their children out of standardized testing. Gee, no issues with privacy or data brokering there.</p>

I say, let prisoners receive federal financial aid so that they can get real degrees, not just MOOC certificates.

<h3>Rolling Stone&#8217;s Horrific Journalistic Failure</h3>
<br />
<p>Rolling Stone officially retracted its story from last November detailing a brutal gang rape at a party at a University of Virginia fraternity. After it was published, the veracity of the rape accusation quickly came into question, and the Columbia School of Journalism agreed to review how the magazine got the story wrong. (<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/a-rape-on-campus-what-went-wrong-20150405">The full text of that review is here</a>.) Despite the errors &#8211; which it acknowledges, Rolling Stone insists its editorial process was not at fault. The magazine&#8217;s publisher, Jann Wenner, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/business/media/rolling-stone-retracts-article-on-rape-at-university-of-virginia.html">calls Jackie</a> (the woman who was the primary source for the story and the victim of the alleged gang rape) &#8220;an expert fabulist storyteller.&#8221; So pretty much, this whole thing is Jackie&#8217;s fault, according to Rolling Stone; not shitty journalism. The fraternity at the center of the story, Phi Kappa Psi, is <a href="http://www.necn.com/news/national-international/Fraternity-Phi-Kappa-Psi-Sue-Rolling-Stone-UVA-Rape-Story-298787161.html">suing the magazine</a>. Considering the track record of sexual assault at that frat and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/sexually-assaulted-at-uva.html">others at UVA</a>, I&#8217;m not sure how well that lawsuit will go for them. For the best summary of the report, <a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2015/04/rolling-stone-jackie-and-what-went-wrong.html">read Melissa McEwan</a>.</p>
