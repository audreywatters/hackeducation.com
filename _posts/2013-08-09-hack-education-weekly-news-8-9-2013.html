<h2>Testing Sturm und Drang</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>New York</strong> Fails <strong>Common Core</strong> Tests,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/new-york-fails-common-core-tests-95304.html">reads the Politico headline</a>. &ldquo;Test Scores Sink as New York Adopts Tougher Benchmarks,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/nyregion/under-new-standards-students-see-sharp-decline-in-test-scores.html">says The New York Times</a>. &ldquo;New York State Stops Lying to Children &ndash; and That&rsquo;s a Good Thing,&rdquo; <a href="http://dropoutnation.net/2013/08/08/new-york-state-stops-lying-to-children-and-thats-a-good-thing/">says Dropout Nation</a>. So yeah, lots of sturm und drang this week as <a href="http://www.p12.nysed.gov/irs/pressRelease/20130807/home.html">New York State released</a> the results of how students performed on this year&rsquo;s tests &ndash; tests that were aligned with the new Common Core State Standards. Fewer than a third passed.</p>
<p>The <strong>Wyoming</strong> Department of Education also <a href="http://edu.wyoming.gov/sf-docs/wde-press-releases/paws-public-release-august-6-.pdf?sfvrsn=2">released</a> the scores for its 2013 Proficiency Assessments for Wyoming Students this week. The proficiency rates declined across all grade levels and content areas when compared to the 2012 exams. This year&rsquo;s exams were partially aligned with the <strong>Common Core State Standards</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Texas Education Agency</strong> has, for the first time, released <a href="http://www.tea.state.tx.us/student.assessment/staar/testquestions/">sample questions from last year&rsquo;s STAAR tests</a> online. Texas is not part of the <strong>Common Core</strong>, for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>Another <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2013/08/board_nixes_naep_trend_test_ad.html">victim</a> of the sequester cuts: the National Assessment of Education Progress or <strong>NAEP</strong>. <a href="http://shankerblog.org/?p=8718">The Shanker Institute&rsquo;s Matthew Di Carlo explains</a> why this is bad news: &ldquo;Although its results are frequently misinterpreted, NAEP is actually among the few standardized tests in the U.S. that receives rather wide support from all &ldquo;sides&rdquo; of the testing debate. And one cannot help but notice the fact that federal and state governments are currently making significant investments in new tests that are used for high-stakes purposes, whereas NAEP, the primary low-stakes assessment, is being scaled back.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong> Schools Superintendent Glenda Ritz <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/us/indiana-grade-manipulation-found.html">has acknowledged</a> that grade manipulation did occur under her predecessor Tony Bennett, a darling of the education reform movement, who instituted a grading system for the state&rsquo;s schools then pushed to have the grade of a charter school run by a donor changed from a C to an A.</p>
<p>The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has <a href="http://legalclips.nsba.org/?p=22669">ruled</a> that a Pennsylvania school district&rsquo;s ban on wearing cancer awareness bracelets that read &ldquo;I &hearts; boobies&rdquo; violated students&rsquo; <strong>First Amendment</strong> free speech rights.</p>
<p><strong>Philadelphia School District</strong> superintendent William Hite Jr <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20130809_Money_woes_could_delay_opening_of_city_schools.html">said</a> that the district might not open on time this fall unless it has assurances by August 16 that it will receive $50 million from the city.</p>
<p>The Obama Administration <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/obama-administration-approves-nclb-waiver-request-california-core-districts">approved</a> <strong>NCLB</strong> waiver requests for 8 <strong>California</strong> school districts. (California has not applied for a NCLB waiver and that these districts have been granted a waiver has been <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/california-districts-get-special-no-child-waiver-95252.html">somewhat controversial</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Kobo</strong> and <strong>Sony</strong> are petitioning the <strong>FCC</strong>, <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/08/07/amazon-kobo-and-sony-petition-fcc-to-exempt-e-readers-from-accessibility-laws/">writes Laura Hazard Owen</a>, &ldquo;to permanently exempt e-readers from certain federal accessibility laws for the disabled, arguing that e-readers are barebones devices designed for a single purpose: reading text.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>National Science Foundation</strong> has <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/nsf-cancels-political-science-grant-cycle-1.13501">cancelled</a> its political science grant funding for the rest of the year, blaming Congress which passed a law requiring that political science research grants benefit either national security or the economy.</p>

<p>The <strong>Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood</strong> has filed a complaint with the <strong>FTC</strong>, charging that <strong>Fisher Price</strong> is <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/childrens-advocacy-group-faults-learning-apps-for-babies/">making false claims</a> about the educational value of its apps aimed at babies. &ldquo;According to the complaints, the companies say in marketing material that their apps teach infants spatial skills, numbers, language or motor skills. But, the complaints claim, there is no rigorous scientific evidence to prove that these kinds of products provide those benefits.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Launches and Upgrades</h2>

<p>Textbook publisher <strong>Boundless</strong> released a major update to its products this week, with premium ($19.99) textbooks, mobile apps, and what its calling &ldquo;Boundless Learning Technology&rdquo; to help students study the textbook material. <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/08/08/lawsuit-be-damned-boundless-learning-pushes-ahead-with-free-textbook-platform/">More via GigaOm</a>.</p>

<h2>Downgrades and Closures</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://wanderwith.us/">Wander</a></strong>, an app that began as a language learning app that pivoted towards photo-sharing and cross-cultural communication, will shut down on August 15.</p>
<h2>MOOCs</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The apocalypse has arrived,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=60965">says Stephen Downes</a>, noting that the <a href="http://m.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newsbyte-development-training-for-sap-hana-successfully-delivered-as-massive-open-online-course-mobile-solutions-development-course-to-begin-soon-218828881.html">European enterprise software giant <strong>SAP</strong> is now offering a MOOC</a>.</p>
<p>The apocalypse doesn&rsquo;t appear on the <strong><a href="http://edutechnica.com/moocmap/">MOOC Map</a></strong>, an interactive map that lets you view the geographical spread of MOOCs from 6 providers (<strong>Coursera</strong>, <strong>Instructure</strong>, <strong>Blackboard</strong>, <strong>edX</strong>, <strong>FutureLearn</strong>, <strong>Open2Study</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Moodle.org</strong> is launching its first MOOC, <a href="http://learn.moodle.net/mod/page/view.php?id=53">Moodle for Teachers</a>. (&ldquo;First,&rdquo; that is, if you don&rsquo;t count the very first MOOCs which were run on Moodle. But we don&rsquo;t count those Canadian MOOCs, I guess&hellip;)</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Maryland University College</strong> says that it will <a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/07/31/umuc-will-be-first-college-in-md-university-system-with-moocs/">offer transfer credits</a> to students who complete MOOCs (or more precisely, who &ldquo;demonstrate learning&rdquo; from 3 Udacity or 3 Coursera courses, ones that have been approved for ACE credit).</p>

<p>Beginning in the 2014&ndash;2015 schools year, <strong>Colorado Virtual Academy</strong> will <a href="http://kunc.org/post/cova-k12-inc-part-ways-new-online-school-proposed-updated">split</a> from <strong>K12</strong>, the for-profit online education provider that currently manages the school. According to KUNC, &ldquo;COVA has struggled with poor academic performance in recent years amid questions about K12 Inc.&rsquo;s management of school resources&mdash;including teacher understaffing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Funding, Acquisitions, and IPOs</h2>
<p>Amazon founder <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/washington-post-to-be-sold-to-jeff-bezos/2013/08/05/ca537c9e-fe0c-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html">purchased</a> the <strong>Washington Post</strong> this week for a cool $250 million. The Washington Post Company will retain its ownership of the for-profit education company <strong>Kaplan</strong> (of test-prep and university &ldquo;fame&rdquo;), as well as its investment in <strong>Edsurge</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</strong> <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/08/05/houghton-mifflin-harcourt-files-for-ipo/P7Emtpt3HojFsgnbsrkAuO/story.html">has filed for an IPO</a>, one year after the company emerged from bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The investment bankers <strong>Berkery Noyes</strong> have <a href="http://www.berkerynoyes.com/publication/trends/13halfeducation.aspx">published a report</a> on investment activity in the education industry during the first half of 2013.</p>
<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>University of New Mexico</strong>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a href="http://news.unm.edu/2013/08/professor-geoffrey-miller-censured-by-unm/">formally censured</a>&nbsp;psychology professor&nbsp;<strong>Geoffrey Miller</strong>&nbsp;for his fat-shaming tweet. Miller will be barred from serving on graduate student admissions committees.</p>
<p>The <strong>Florida Virtual School</strong> has laid off 177 full-time and 625 part-time instructors over the last two months, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/fla-virtual-school-lays-off-192257912.html">according to the AP</a>. The layoffs are a result of declining enrollments, say the online school&rsquo;s spokesperson.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong> should have fun filling its education positions. Last week, Superintendent Tony Bennett resigned. This week, it&rsquo;s <strong><a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/college/frank-brogan-chancellor-of-floridas-university-system-leaving-for/2135231">Frank Brogan</a></strong>, chancellor of the state university system, who&rsquo;s leaving. He&rsquo;ll be taking a similar role in <strong>Pennsylvania</strong>.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The <strong>obesity</strong> rate among preschool-age children from poor families fell in 19 states and United States territories between 2008 and 2011,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/health/broad-decline-in-obesity-rate-seen-in-poor-young-children.html">say federal health officials</a>.</p>
<p>Students who transfer from <strong>community colleges</strong> into four-year programs with a degree or certificate under their belt are more likely to attain their Bachelors, according to a report released by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center (<a href="http://www.studentclearinghouse.info/signature/5//NSC_Signature_Report_5.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>The New York Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/education/edlife/calculating-the-net-worth-of-a-college-degree.html">calculated</a> the <strong>net worth of a college degree</strong>, and according to its math, <strong>Harvey Mudd College</strong> offers the best return on investment. The worst? <strong>The Art Institute of Pittsburgh</strong>. Me, I kinda want Nate Silver's opinion on this...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only 35 Percent of College-educated Workers Consider All or Most of What They Learned in College to be Applicable to Their Current Jobs, According to a <strong>University of Phoenix</strong> Survey.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.heraldonline.com/2013/08/02/5079823/only-35-percent-of-college-educated.html">That&rsquo;s a real headline on a real press release</a> that claims, among other things, that nearly 75% of adults have regrets about their education.</p>
<p>But the best bullshit press release this week goes to <strong>USA Gold</strong> pencils which surveyed people about whether or not they think that students need to learn <strong>cursive</strong>. (The <strong>Common Core State Standards</strong> call for keyboarding in lieu of cursive instruction.) &ldquo;Does Abandoning Cursive in Schools Write Off Our Children&rsquo;s Future?&rdquo; <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/USAGoldPencils/CursiveSurvey/prweb10999782.htm">asks the press release</a>, stirring up as much doom and panic as a pencil-sponsored survey can muster.</p>
<h2>Conferences</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/10/08/alec-and-ed-tech/">ALEC</a></strong>, the American Legislative Exchange Council, held its annual meeting in Chicago this week. The keynote speaker: former Florida governor <strong>Jeb Bush</strong>. <a href="http://excelined.org/news/governor-jeb-bush-delivers-education-reform-address-to-the-american-legislative-exchange-council/">A few lines from his speech</a>: &ldquo;Those vested in the status quo lash out with political and personal attacks. They hatch conspiracy theories about plots to destroy public education.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Science-Free Shark Week</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s <strong>Shark Week</strong>, the <strong>Discovery Channel</strong>&rsquo;s week of shark TV programming. But the channel has faced some pushback this week as its kickoff show, <em>Megalodon: The Monster Shark That Lives</em>, was a mockumentary, one that claimed that the ancient shark is actually not extinct. <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/2013/08/05/shark-week-jumps-the-shark-an-open-letter-to-discovery-communications">Science education fail</a>.</p>
