<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>This episode was recorded live as part of the plenary session we gave at the <a href="http://sloanconsortium.org/conference/2012/et4online/welcome">Emerging Technologies for Online Learning</a> symposium in Las Vegas. I really enjoyed having a live audience (and not just because it's useful to hear the laughter or dead silence when I make a joke), and as such, Steve and I are weighing how we can include that element in our weekly podcasts. &nbsp;Perhaps we'll try Google Hangouts. &nbsp;We'll see...</p>
