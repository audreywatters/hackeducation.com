<p>Once a year, I crack open Google Analytics to see what traffic to Hack Education has looked like so that I can write another one of these year-end posts. (<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/12/30/top-posts-of-2013">2013</a>, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/30/top-posts-of-2012">2012</a>, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2011/12/31/hack-education%27s-top-11-stories-of-2011">2011</a>, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2010/12/30/the-best-of-hack-education-2010">2010</a>)</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/hackedu-site/blog/graph_up_150.png" align="right" style="margin:15px">I don&#8217;t really/regularly pay attention to metrics like pageviews. Are writers supposed to? I dunno&#8230; I write because it helps me think. I don&#8217;t write so that people will click, although I am glad that some people do. Indeed, with the <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/12/25/pigeons">revamp</a> of this site, I&#8217;ve ditched Google Analytics. So this time next year, I&#8217;ll just shrug and say &#8220;I guess some folks read some stuff.&#8221; This year, however, I can still be specific about what that stuff was:</p>

<h3>A Couple of Observations on the Clicking</h3>
<br />
<p><strong>Hate-Clicks</strong>: Once again, my stories on Khan Academy and Codecademy remain the most trafficked pieces on this site. They also generate the most hate-mail. So that&#8217;s fun.</p>

<p><strong>The Business of Ed-Tech</strong>: There&#8217;s an appetite for analysis of the business of ed-tech apparently, as folks clicked on some fairly old posts about startups and investors. I guess I could look to see how quickly those readers left this site, but that would mean opening Google Analytics again.</p>

<p><strong>Talk Transcripts</strong>: These sorts of lists are biased towards blog posts from previous years &#8211; that is, those old ones get a full 12 months&#8217; worth of traffic. Just 7 out of my top 20 stories were written this year. Of those, 5 were transcripts from my talks &#8211; validation, I suppose, for posting them online. I&#8217;m not sure it proves that people will actually read long-form content about ed-tech (again, that would require looking at Google Analytics). But I am very pleased that some of the work I&#8217;m most proud of this year made the list: <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/11/18/gender-and-ed-tech">Men Explain Technology to Me</a> and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/09/03/monsters-altc2014">Ed-Tech&#8217;s Monsters</a>. </p>

<p>So here&#8217;s to writing more in 2015 (and ignoring the metrics)...</p>
