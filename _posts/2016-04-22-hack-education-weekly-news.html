Morgan Chase,&#8221; <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/04/21/florida-man-bitcoin/">reports Fortune</a>. And here&#8217;s the kicker: &#8220;Michael Murgio, who serves on a school board in Palm Beach County, was charged in an indictment filed in federal court in Manhattan for participating in a scheme to pay bribes to let the bitcoin exchange’s operators gain control of a credit union.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>AltSchool</strong> Pulls New COO From &#8216;<strong>Call of Duty</strong>&#8217; Video Game Company,&#8221; <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-04-21-altschool-pulls-new-coo-from-call-of-duty-video-game-company">Edsurge reports</a>. Call of Duty is often touted for its ultra-violence, but hey! If I was going to combine the horror of school-as-surveillance with a violent video game, I would definitely go with Call of Duty. Anyway, the hiring of former Activision exec Coddy Johnson is positioned by ed-tech insiders as Very Exciting News. AltSchool CEO and founder Max Ventilla told Edsurge that &#8220;There aren&#8217;t a lot of people who have multiple times, managed a thousand-plus organization and done it in a way where anyone you talked to says they're absolutely incredible from a leadership perspective.&#8221; Incidentally, AltSchool does not have that many employees, not even close, and Edsurge confirms reports <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/03/11/hack-education-weekly-news">I&#8217;d heard</a> earlier this year that the startup has laid off many educators and members of its &#8220;school operations&#8221; team. The Edsurge article touts the education experience of the new hire &#8211; that he is on the board of Twigtale, a &#8220;personalized&#8221; children&#8217;s book startup, for startups. Not mentioned: Twigtale is a startup founded by Johnson's wife, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Southworth">Carrie Southworth</a>. Its investors include Ivanka Trump and Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s ex-wife Wendi Deng. And Johnson himself is the godson of <strong>George W. Bush</strong>. Johnson&#8217;s dad was roommates with the former President while at <strong>Yale</strong>. Small world, I guess, when one is revolutionizing the future of education.</p>

<p><strong>Claude Steele</strong>, the executive vice chancellor and provost at <strong>UC Berkeley</strong>, has resigned. &#8220;Mr. Steele&#8217;s abrupt departure comes at a time of turmoil for the university, as he and other top administrators have been criticized for their handling of a widening sexual harassment scandal,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/us/provost-resigns-amid-sexual-harassment-case-at-berkeley.html">according to The New York Times</a>.</p>
