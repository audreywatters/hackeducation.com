<h2>RIP Stuart Hall</h2>
<p>Cultural theorist <strong>Stuart Hall</strong> <a href="http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/jamaican-cultural-theorist-stuart-hall-dies-aged-82">passed away</a> this week. He was 82. His work on race, power, culture, class, gender, and identity had an immense effect on my own scholarship, but also shaped how I think of myself as a beneficiary of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/10/stuart-hall-cultural-legacy-britain-godfather-multiculturalism">Empire</a>.&rdquo; I thank him immensely for that.</p>
<p>Before we all get too gleeful with the hype of &ldquo;coding,&rdquo; let&rsquo;s not forget &ldquo;<a href="http://www.art.buffalo.edu/coursenotes/ART250/250A/_assets/_readings/encoding_decoding_hall.pdf">encoding/decoding</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Year of Code, UK Style</h2>
<p>Of course, nothing puts a dent in &ldquo;<strong>learn to code</strong>&rdquo; hype like a <a href="http://youtu.be/-7x7GYItzS4">BBC interview like this one</a>. Lottie Dexter, the head of the UK&rsquo;s Year of Code initiative, doesn&rsquo;t know how to code. (<a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/year-of-code-boss-lottie-dexter-is-car.html">And that&rsquo;s really just the start of it</a>&hellip;)</p>
<h2>MOOCs</h2>
<p>Copy-and-pasted from <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/soundviewpro-launches-free-massive-open-online-courses-for-organizational-skill-enhancement-239908361.html">the press release</a> here without comment: &ldquo;<strong>Soundview</strong> Executive Book Summaries&reg;, the leader in executive education and corporate training, announced today the launch of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) via its sister company, SoundviewPro.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-14/massive-online-education-gets-less-massive.html">According to Bloomberg</a>, &ldquo;Massive Online Education Gets Less Massive.&rdquo; You know, sorta like &ldquo;<strong>online education</strong>&rdquo; or something.</p>
<p>Similarly, I never know if I should put the&nbsp;online education startup <strong>NovoEd</strong> in this MOOC category as it focuses on small private online groups and courses. Anyhoo. It <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/leading-institutions-work-with-novoed-to-offer-collaborative-online-social-learning-245380521.html">announced</a> that it was expanding its partnerships this week to 16 new institutions, including <strong>Stanford</strong>, <strong>Princeton</strong>, <strong>University of Michigan</strong>, and the <strong>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</strong>.</p>
<p>Students at <strong>Cornell University</strong> and <strong>UT Austin</strong> aren&rsquo;t so keen on MOOCs, <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/12/ut-austin-and-cornell-u-students-question-their-institutions-investments-moocs">reports Inside Higher Ed</a>, which draws on stories in student newspapers. &ldquo;The university hasn&rsquo;t laid out long-term goals for the MOOCs, and the numbers don&rsquo;t bode particularly well for the courses&rsquo; overall success,&rdquo; one editorial reads. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re confused as to why an unproven and unused educational experiment that isn&rsquo;t even aimed at UT students is something the system feels they should continue funding.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>HarvardX</strong> will <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/10/harvardx-to-provide-online/">launch</a> MOOCs exclusive to <strong>Harvard</strong> alumni this spring, says The Harvard Crimson. Because &ldquo;open.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Elsewhere on Campus&hellip;</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/henrygoldman/this-is-the-scared-straight-you-wish-youd-gone-to-when-you-w">Buzzfeed</a></strong> tries to scare kids out of majoring in the <strong>liberal arts</strong>. Probably because kids that develop good critical thinking skills are less likely to click on dumb listicle posts.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s this gem: &ldquo;Bruce Leslie, chancellor of the <strong>Alamo Colleges</strong>, is hoping that the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board will approve his bid for a course heavily influenced by the popular self-help book <strong><em>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em></strong> to become part of the core curriculum, in place of a humanities course,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/11/faculty-object-plan-replace-humanities-requirement-self-help-course">writes Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Akron</strong> is considering shuttering 55 academic programs, the majority from the humanities. More <a href="http://bryanalexander.org/2014/02/07/university-of-akron-goes-for-the-queen-sacrifice/">via Bryan Alexander&rsquo;s blog</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>University of the People</strong> has received accreditation, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/education/free-online-university-receives-accreditation-in-time-for-graduating-class-of-7.html">reports The New York Times</a>. Accreditation comes via the Distance Education and Training Council and means that the non-profit, which offers free online education globally, can officially award degrees.</p>
<p>The Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges has <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/education/2014/02/07/city-college-of-san-francisco-loses-bid-to-reverse-accreditation-ruling/">rejected</a> the request by the <strong>City College of San Francisco</strong> to reverse the decision revoking the community college&rsquo;s accreditation.</p>
<p>A new <a href="http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2014/02/13/california-alliance/">consortium</a> called the California Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate has been formed to increase the diversity of students in STEM fields. Consortium members include <strong>UC Berkeley</strong>, <strong>UCLA</strong>, <strong>Caltech</strong>, and <strong>Stanford</strong>.</p>
<h2>School vs. Weather</h2>
<p>Another week of terrible weather across the planet. But hey, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to make a <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/durham-academy-school-officials-deliver-a-snow-day-announcement-by-rapping-to-ice-ice-baby/">viral video</a> when your school closes, so there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<h2>This Week in 1:1</h2>
<p><strong>Miami-Dade County</strong> says that it&rsquo;s moving forward with the school district&rsquo;s plans for a massive 1:1 computing roll-out, starting this spring. The $200,000 initiative will distribute Hewlett Packard and Lenovo<strong> Windows 8 devices</strong>. More <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/02/miami-dade_district_1-to-1_com.html">via Education Week</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/200-libby-clark/761499-pennsylvania-high-school-rolls-out-1700-linux-laptops-to-students">Linux.com highlights</a> the move of Penn Manor High School in Lancaster, <strong>Pennsylvania</strong> to laptops that run <strong>Ubuntu</strong>. &ldquo;We encourage our students to install software and lift the hood of the system to better understand what makes it tick,&rdquo; says the district&rsquo;s IT director.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in <strong>Los Angeles</strong>&hellip; bwa ha ha ha ha! Oh, and LAUSD school officials &ldquo;have failed for now in their efforts to get full access to a digital curriculum that the school system purchased in June,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-no-access-ipad-curriculum-20140206,0,2835393.story#axzz2sdQnjghR">reports The LA Times</a>.</p>
<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p><strong>New Jersey Education Commissioner Chris Cerf</strong> is <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/NJ_education_chief_Chris_Cerf_stepping_down.html">stepping down</a>&hellip; and taking a job at News Corp&rsquo;s <strong>Amplify</strong>. Nothing to see here. Move along...</p>
<p><strong>Geoffrey Canada</strong> is <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304104504579374683579192314?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304104504579374683579192314.html">resigning</a> as head of the <strong>Harlem Children&rsquo;s Zone</strong>, a non-profit which runs Promise Academy Charter Schools.</p>
<p><strong>Rutgers University</strong> has <a href="http://www.nj.com/education/2014/02/rutgers_suspends_top_anthropology_professor_for_allegedly_refusing_to_teach_report_says.html">suspended</a> anthropologist Robert Trivers after he allegedly told his students that he knew nothing about the &ldquo;Human Aggression&rdquo; class but that his department was forcing him to teach it anyway. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sound immodest, but I am one of the greatest social theorists in evolutionary biology alive, period,&rdquo; Trivers told the college newspaper. So great, I guess, that he&rsquo;s unable to learn anything new with and for his students.</p>
<h2>Education, Politics, and The Law</h2>
<p>The <strong>New York State Board of Regents</strong> <a href="http://www.oms.nysed.gov/press/regents-adjust-common-core-implementation.html">announced</a> this week that it plans to delay full implementation of the <strong>Common Core State Standards</strong> until 2022. It also delayed the state&rsquo;s launch of <strong>inBloom</strong>-powered data dashboards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>New York Supreme Court</strong> Judge Thomas Breslin has dismissed a parent-led lawsuit against <strong>inBloom</strong>. <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-02-09-ny-parent-lawsuit-against-inbloom-dismissed">Edsurge covers the decision</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Orange County</strong> district attorney&rsquo;s office has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-charter-school-board-member-charged-theft-20140212,0,5621980.story#axzz2tGsI0jUc">filed charges</a> against Jeremy Landau, a former board member of the <strong>California Virtual Education Partners</strong>, accusing him of stealing $750,000 from the charter school organization.</p>

<p><strong>Editorially</strong>, a collaborative online writing tool, will be <a href="https://editorially.com/">shutting down</a> May 30. Bummer, and best of luck to the talented team working on this startup.</p>
<h2>Funding and Acquisitions</h2>
<p><strong>Comcast</strong> <a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2014/02/12/comcast-to-buy-time-warner-cable-in-44-2-billion-all-stock-deal-says-cnbc/">announced</a> its plans to buy <strong>Time Warner Cable</strong>. Terrible news for customers. Terrible news for competition. Another blow for net neutrality. Well, this whole WWW thing was pretty fun while it lasted, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Three Ring</strong>, a startup that digitizes student work to aid with assessment, has raised $1 million in funding, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-02-11-three-ring-raises-1m-to-digitize-student-work">reports Edsurge</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Curious</strong>, a start-up that allowed teachers to sell &ldquo;bite-size lessons&rdquo; &ldquo;on topics that range from proper sewing technique and Pilates classes for beginners to advanced MS Excel wrangling&rdquo; has raised $15 million, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/5k-videos-and-counting-curious-lands-15m-from-gsv-to-help-teachers-monetize-bite-sized-lessons/">reports Techcrunch</a> (which always amazes me, incidentally, for its ability to churn out thousands of words in its education articles without really saying anything interesting).</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p>The <strong>Pew Research Center</strong> released a <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/">report</a> on &ldquo;The Rising Cost of Not Going to College.&rdquo; &ldquo;The economic analysis finds that Millennial college graduates ages 25 to 321 who are working full time earn more annually&mdash;about $17,500 more&mdash;than employed young adults holding only a high school diploma. The pay gap was significantly smaller in previous generations.&rdquo;</p>
