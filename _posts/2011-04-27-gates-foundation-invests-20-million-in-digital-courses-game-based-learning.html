<p>The <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx">Gates Foundation</a> continues to demonstrate its commitment to funding education technology efforts today with the announcement of another major round of investments.  The Gates Foundation will invest more than $20 million in a number of programs that will focus on game-based and <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/12/09/the-year-in-ed-tech-part-4-social-learning-social-networks/">social learning</a>.</p>
<h2>Boost for Common Core Courseware</h2>
<p>The resources will all align with the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/">Common Core State Standards</a>, the curriculum standards that have been actively promoted by the Gates Foundation and have been adopted by more than 40 states.</p>
<p>Much of the investment today will go towards building out digital courses -- some online and some blended learning -- aligned in support of Common Core, an endeavor with the Gates Foundation has paired with the <a href="http://www.pearsonfoundation.org/">Pearson Foundation</a>, the philanthropic arm of <a href="http://www.pearson.com/">Pearson</a>, the world's largest education company.  The Pearson Foundation will develop 24 online math and language arts digital courses, which will eventually be made available at no cost to schools.  <a href="http://www.flvs.net/Pages/default.aspx">Florida Virtual School</a>, the country's first state-wide <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/florida_virtual_school_is_this_what_the_school_of.php">Internet-based public high school</a>, has also received funding to build two math and two language arts courses.</p>
<p>It's hard to argue with the notion that there are things every child should know. But the Common Core Standards have been viewed <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/national-standards/the-problems-with-the-common-c.html">skeptically</a> by some who see them as part of a move towards a nationalized curriculum and as a part of a trend towards increased standardized testing.</p>
<h2>Investing in Game-Based Learning</h2>
<p>About a third of the round of financing announced today will go to support a variety of game-based learning tools.  As I wrote over on <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/04/can-gamification-boost-independent-learning/">MindShift</a> today, gaming and gamification hold a lot of promise for more engaged, collaborative learning.</p>
<p>The funded projects include:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>iRemix, a <a href="http://www.digitalyouthnetwork.org/">Digital Youth Network</a> project includes a set of 20 literacy-based trajectories where students tcano earn badges and "level up" in areas like creative writing</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.instituteofplay.org/">Institute of Play</a> will build a set of game-based pedagogical tools and game design curricula.</li>
<li><a href="http://atlantis.crlt.indiana.edu/">Quest Atlantis</a> is development video <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/games/">games</a> that build proficiency in math, literacy and science.</li>
</ul>
<p>The announcement of this round of investment follows news earlier this week from another Gates Foundation-funded program:  the <a href="http://nextgenlearning.org/">Next Generation Learning Challenges</a>.  The NGLC announced the <a href="http://nextgenlearning.org/wave-ii-finalists">finalists</a> for its <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/01/19/gates-foundation-offers-10-million-in-grant-money-for-middle-school-math-literacy-programs/">second wave of grants</a>, aimed at boosting the college-preparedness of middle-schoolers.  This $10 million in grant money will also support the Common Core State Standards.</p>
