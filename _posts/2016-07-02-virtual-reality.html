<p>Virtual reality is, once again, being heralded as a technology poised to transform education. I say &#8220;once again&#8221; because virtual reality has long been associated with such promises. VR appeared in some of the earliest Horizon Reports for example, with <a href="http://www.nmc.org/sites/default/files/pubs/1316813966/2007_Horizon_Report.pdf">the 2007 report</a> positing that virtual worlds would be adopted by higher ed institutions within two to three years&#8217; time; funnily enough, <a href="http://cdn.nmc.org/media/2016-nmc-horizon-report-he-EN.pdf">the 2016 report</a> offers the same outlook: we&#8217;re still two to three years out from widespread adoption of VR. </p>

<p>The history of VR goes back much farther than this &#8211; the phrase &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; was <a href="http://www.vrs.org.uk/virtual-reality/who-coined-the-term.html">coined</a> in 1987 by Jaron Lanier, but attempts to create the illusion of being somewhere else &#8211; through art and/or technology &#8211; <a href="http://www.vrs.org.uk/virtual-reality/history.html">date back farther still</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/28/the-technology-of-higher-education/">But this time it&#8217;s different</a>.&#8221; That&#8217;s the common response from some quarters to my (repeated) assertion that there&#8217;s a substantial history to education technologies &#8211; to both the technologies themselves and to the educational purposes for which they&#8217;re designed or utilized &#8211; that is consistently ignored. </p>

<p>This much is true: augmented reality and virtual reality startups have seen <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/vr-funding-2015/">record-setting levels</a> of venture capital <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/ar-vs-vr/">in recent years</a> predicated on advancements in the tech (although much of that investment has gone to just a handful of companies, such as <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/03/07/magic-leap-1-billion-investment/">Magic Leap</a>). In 2014, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/21/facebooks-acquisition-of-oculus-closes-now-official/">Facebook acquired Oculus VR</a>, Google released its Cardboard viewer, and Playstation announced it was working on a VR gaming headset &#8211; these have all been interpreted in turn as signs that virtual reality will soon be <a href="http://www.popsci.com/game-changer-playstation-vr">mainstream</a>. </p>

<p>&#8220;Soon.&#8221; As the New Media Consortium&#8217;s annual reports should serve to remind us, VR has always been &#8220;on the horizon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s ed-tech entrepreneurs are wont to claim that they&#8217;ll be the &#8220;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-02-23-what-is-virtual-reality-s-role-in-education-an-interview-with-nearpod-cofounder-felipe-sommer">first</a>&#8221; to bring virtual reality to schools, and that today&#8217;s ed-tech journalists rarely fact-check or dispute these statements underscores how little either seems to know or care about ed-tech history. But the problem, as some long-time VR developers <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/11/360-video-isnt-virtual-reality/">insist</a>, isn&#8217;t simply that these folks don&#8217;t know much about technology&#8217;s past: it&#8217;s that they don&#8217;t know their research (also a huge problem); and quite arguably, they seem unfamiliar with any of the debates about design or definitions. I mean, <strong>what <em>is</em> virtual reality?</strong> </p>

<h3>Educational Stereoscopy</h3>
<br />
<p>There&#8217;s a hint as to an answer to that question &#8211; or at least to the question &#8220;what <em>isn&#8217;t</em> virtual reality?&#8221; &#8211; in this Wired headline from late last year: &#8220;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/11/360-video-isnt-virtual-reality/">Stop Calling Google Cardboard&#8217;s 360-Degree Videos &#8216;VR&#8217;</a>.&#8221; But in many ways, I fear, the answer (and the definition) might not matter. If the product label says it&#8217;s VR, then it&#8217;s VR; if the pundits and press say it&#8217;s innovation, then it&#8217;s innovation; <a href="http://educationnext.org/virtual-reality-disruption-3d-technology-education/">if they say it&#8217;s disruption, then it&#8217;s disruption</a>. </p>

<p>Even with new, consumer-oriented VR devices coming (soon! right?) to market, the bar for &#8220;what counts&#8221; as virtual reality might be getting lower, particularly for schools &#8211; who, in fairness, would be unlikely to afford the high-end machinery VR requires, something that was also <a href="http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2011/06/15/03secondlife.h04.html">a stumbling block</a> a decade ago when the promises of &#8220;virtual worlds&#8221; in education mostly involved Second Life. Nowadays the adjective &#8220;virtual&#8221; is applied to all sorts of digital media, games, and simulations with such frequency that the phrase &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; might have lost almost all meaning or specificity. </p>

<p>Virtual reality, at least in its &#8220;purest&#8221; or strictest sense, does still require some very expensive and cumbersome hardware in order to create something more than an &#8220;immersive&#8221; <em>viewing</em> experience. Headsets. Gloves. Sensors. Projectors. Processors. To truly provide a virtual <em>reality</em>, the technology must achieve &#8220;sensory immersion in a virtual environment, including a sense of presence,&#8221; game developer and VR scholar Brenda Laurel recently <a href="https://medium.com/@blaurel/what-is-virtual-reality-77b876d829ba#.gongffe8h">argued</a>, listing a series of requisite characteristics almost entirely absent from the multimedia products <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/search?search-query=virtual%20reality">marketed to schools as VR</a>.</p>

<p>The focus of many these products remains a <em>visual</em> learning experience, and as such, the slideshows and videos peddled by today&#8217;s ed-tech companies offer about as much &#8220;VR&#8221; as the Victorian stereoscope. (The technique of creating an illusion of three-dimensionality is <a href="http://krystalboehlert.com/2015/12/stereoscoping-with-google-cardboard/">almost identical</a>: a combination of lenses and imagery that trick the brain into interpreting depth.) </p>

<p>But just as striking as the parallel between the old and new stereoscopy technology is the similarity of their marketing messages: why should schools adopt this technology? The rationale for these latest &#8220;View-Masters&#8221; is almost unchanged from that offered by new media proponents almost a century ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Learn about other cultures.&#8221; &#8220;Visit faraway lands without leaving the classroom.&#8221; &#8220;Guided tours of places school buses cannot go.&#8221; &#8220;Modern pedagogical methods require modern media.&#8221; &#8220;Pictures speak a universal language.&#8221; &#8220;This is science.&#8221;</p>

<p>Google has been among the loudest lately at trumpeting the potential for &#8220;virtual field trips&#8221; with its <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/">Expeditions</a> product. But as I&#8217;ve argued previously, it&#8217;s not remotely clear that <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/05/28/virtual-field-trips">the positive benefits of going on <em>actual</em> field trips</a> extend to the experience of watching a 360 degree video via a <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/10/04/vr">device strapped to your face</a>. (Okay okay, these new VR products certainly sound a lot less exciting when I describe them that way.) We don&#8217;t believe that field trips are the equivalent of watching educational films in class, do we? So why is VR any different? </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-06-12-virtual-reality-cultural-exchange-and-empathy-an-interview-with-global-nomads-grace-lau">the marketing hype</a> &#8211; offered with very little recognition of any media research or media history &#8211; VR will be a new and unique &#8220;empathy machine.&#8221; A century after Thomas Edison&#8217;s famous assertion that &#8220;books will soon be obsolete in schools&#8221; thanks to the wonders of film, watching movies in class is re-presented as progressive pedagogy, as technological innovation.</p>

<h3>Educational Simulations</h3>
<br />
<p>There&#8217;s a different thread that one can trace to tell the history of VR in education &#8211; not merely watching educational films, in other words &#8211; and that&#8217;s the history of training simulations, which, if it includes <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/Lenoir-Lowood_TheatersOfWar.pdf">modern war games</a>, dates back at least to the early 19th century. (The military&#8217;s contributions to education technology are often overlooked, in a quest perhaps to position ed-tech as pedagogically, if not politically progressive. Or perhaps, again, it&#8217;s simply that folks don&#8217;t give a damn about history.)</p>

<p>The pedagogical structure and implications of simulations are quite different than those of &#8220;virtual field trips.&#8221; Rather than emphasizing learn-by-<em>seeing</em>, that is, educational simulations tout learn-by-<em>doing</em>. Or ideally, they do &#8211; a recent list of &#8220;<a href="http://touchstoneresearch.com/the-top-10-companies-working-on-education-in-virtual-reality-and-augmented-reality/">The Top 10 Companies Working on Education in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</a>&#8221; described this gem: &#8220;Lecture VR is a VR app &#8230; which simulates a lecture hall in virtual reality.&#8221; (There are echoes of Second Life here, no doubt, when <a href="http://fusion.net/story/181901/we-took-a-tour-of-the-abandoned-college-campuses-of-second-life/">universities carefully reconstructed</a> their campuses and classrooms in a virtual setting.)</p>

<p>Many ed-tech products like to tout their constructivist principles, but sometimes these reduce &#8220;learn-by-doing&#8221; to &#8220;learn-by-clicking.&#8221; Many simulations are just that: click on the scalpel in the frog dissection simulation app; touch the screen in the surgery simulation app; click on the airplane controls in the flight simulation app.</p>

<p>Virtual simulations promise that learning experiences can be undertaken more safely (and sometimes more cost-effectively). That&#8217;s certainly the appeal of virtual frog dissection, virtual surgery, virtual flight training, and the like. </p>

<p>One of the earliest flight simulators &#8211; and yes, this predates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator">the Microsoft software</a> by over fifty years, but postdates the Wright Brothers by only about twenty &#8211; was developed by Edwin Link. He received <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US1825462">the patent</a> for his device in 1931, a machine that replicated the cockpit and its instruments. The trainer would pitch and roll and dive and climb, powered by a motor and organ bellows. (Link&#8217;s family owned an organ factory.)</p>

<p>Although Link&#8217;s first customers were amusement parks &#8211; and you can see on the patent title that the machine was called a &#8220;Combination training device for student aviators and entertainment apparatus&#8221; &#8211; the military bought six in June of 1934, following a series of plane crashes earlier that year immediately following the US Army Air Corps&#8217; takeover of US Air Mail service. These accidents served to underscore the lack of pilots&#8217; lack of training, particularly under night-time or inclement weather conditions.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2016-07-02-patent.jpg"</p>

<p>By the end of World War II, some 500,000 pilots had used the &#8220;Link Trainer,&#8221; and flight simulators have since become an integral part of pilot (and subsequently, astronaut) training.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2016-07-02-link.jpg"></p>

<p><em>(<a href="https://www.asme.org/getmedia/d75b81fd-83e8-4458-aba7-166a87d35811/210-Link-C-3-Flight-Trainer.aspx">Image credits</a>)</em></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a materiality, by design, to the flight simulator. Obviously, it&#8217;s meant to closely replicate the experience of flying an airplane. In the safety of training facility, you can get a &#8220;feel&#8221; for the controls; you can get a &#8220;feel&#8221; for how to react to turbulence. That &#8220;feel&#8221; is physical; it isn&#8217;t just visual and it isn&#8217;t virtual. It isn&#8217;t about having &#8220;empathy&#8221; for a pilot or the plane. The simulation provides an embodied experience <em>as</em> a pilot.</p>

<p>The body matters to learning.</p>

<h3>VR, Mind, and Body-less-ness</h3>
<br />

<p><em>(<a href="https://unimersiv.com/virtual-reality-education/">Image credits</a>)</em></p>

<p>Despite the promise of "immersion" in another reality, many of today&#8217;s VR products aimed at schools (<a href="http://www.willatworklearning.com/2006/05/people_remember.html">often invoking specious scientific claims</a> as the &#8220;case study&#8221; above demonstrates) don&#8217;t seem to think much about education and embodiment &#8211; that is, the materiality of our lived and learning experiences &#8211; despite, again from the example above, of an invocation of constructionism. (Actually, I&#8217;m pretty sure the company above meant &#8220;constructivism&#8221; here, since &#8220;constructionism&#8221; builds upon the learn-by-doing of constructivism by stressing the importance of the <em>tangible</em> not just the abstract.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m reminded here of N. Katherine Hayles&#8217; work in <em>How We Became Posthuman</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>one could argue that the erasure of embodiment is a feature common to <em>both</em> the liberal humanist subject and the cybernetic posthuman. Identified with the rational mind, the liberal subject <em>possessed</em> a body but was not usually represented as <em>being</em> a body. Only because the body is not identified with the self is it possible to claim for the liberal subject its notorious universality, a claim that depends on erasing markers of bodily difference, including sex, race, and ethnicity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This erasure of bodies and identities and difference <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/07/30/tressie-mcmillan-cottom-ideology-identity-regimes">runs throughout</a> today&#8217;s education technologies (built, as they still overwhelmingly are, by white men). Even without a VR headset, there&#8217;s a disembodied-ness with most digital learning. The imagined student using these new technologies is a &#8220;roaming autodidact,&#8221; as <a href="https://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/inequality-regimes-and-student-experience-in-online-learning-tressie-mcmillan-cottom">Tressie McMillan Cottom has argued</a>.</p>

<p>And the imagined subject matter?</p>
