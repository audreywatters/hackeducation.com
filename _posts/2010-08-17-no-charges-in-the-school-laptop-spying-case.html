Federal prosecutors announced today that they would not be filing charges against the Pennsylvania school district that installed software on its laptops to remotely monitor students.  In February, a student sued the district, claiming that his school's laptop webcam photographed him over 400 times over a two week period.  Investigators said they found no evidence of criminal intent on the part of the Lower Merion School District employees.<p></p>
The district acknowledges they captured some 58,000 screenshots and images, but said this was part of a laptop recovery project.  The student who sued claims he never reported his laptop missing or stolen.  <p></p>

On one hand, I completely understand schools needing to have security devices on their equipment.  But why not something like <a href="http://www.absolute.com/en/lojackforlaptops/">LoJack</a> that pinpoints the location of the laptop, rather than something that snaps a photo and/or a screenshot every couple of minutes?  The district said they also captured the student's video and chat messages.  I don't know -- it strikes me as though the "security" features on these laptops were really about monitoring students, not solving crime.
