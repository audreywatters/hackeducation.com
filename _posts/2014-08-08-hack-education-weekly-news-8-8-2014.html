<h2>Education Politics</h2>
<p>It looks like the <strong>Department of Education</strong> <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/documents-show-what-the-department-of-education-knew-about-c">knew more</a> about the state of <strong>Corinthian Colleges</strong>&rsquo; finances than it&rsquo;s let on.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2014/08/digitization/texas-superintendent-adopts-digitized-early-learning-program/"><strong>Texas</strong> Superintendent Adopts Digitized Early Learning Program</a></p>
<p>The <strong>Indiana</strong> Department of Education has reached a <a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/stateimpact/2014/08/06/state-receive-3-million-istep-glitches/">settlement</a> with <strong>CTB/McGraw Hill</strong>, which will pay the state $3 million after tech glitches interrupted testing last year.</p>
<p><strong>Montana</strong> Senator John Walsh has <a href="http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/08/walsh-quits-senate-bid-in-montana-after-plagiarism-scandal/375761/">ended</a> his re-election campaign after being caught in a <strong>plagiarism</strong> scandal (namely, plagiarizing more than a quarter of his master&rsquo;s thesis at the Army War College.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/us/celebrated-trial-lawyer-david-boies-to-head-group-challenging-teacher-tenure.html?_r=3">From The New York Times</a>: &ldquo;<strong>David Boies</strong>, the star trial lawyer who helped lead the legal charge that overturned California&rsquo;s same-sex marriage ban, is becoming chairman of the Partnership for Educational Justice, a group that former CNN anchor <strong>Campbell Brown</strong> founded in part to pursue lawsuits challenging <strong>teacher tenure</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I disagree with their edu politics, I can&rsquo;t help but notice the sexist framing of many stories about <a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/The_Campbell_Brown_Moment"><strong>Campbell Brown</strong></a> and <a href="http://deadspin.com/the-man-who-helped-bring-down-donald-sterling-is-an-ass-1576960521/1617259572/+dave-mckenna"><strong>Michelle Rhee</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Catherine Sugrue, who&rsquo;s twice failed the <strong>Chicago Public Schools</strong>&rsquo; selection test for principals, will become the principal at Gray Elementary. Sugrue is the sister of Chicago Alderman Patrick O&rsquo;Connor. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-principal-named-after-rule-change-met-20140801-story.html">Ah, Chicago politics</a>.</p>

<h2>Go, School Sports Team!</h2>

Mmhmm. I&rsquo;m sure it had nothing to do with his efforts to curb faculty free speech or the university&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/sports/oregonian/john_canzano/index.ssf/2014/05/canzano_its_a_cover-up_at_the.html">questionable actions</a> following a rape of a young woman by 3 of the school&rsquo;s basketball players.</p>
