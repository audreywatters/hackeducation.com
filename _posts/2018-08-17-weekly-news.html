<p><em>Each week, I gather a wide variety of links to education and education technology articles. All this feeds the review I write each December on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the stories we are told</a> about the future of education.</em></p>

<h3>(National) Education Politics <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2018_icon_politics2.jpg" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />

Wants to Hold Colleges Accountable by Reporting <strong>Graduates&#8217; Earnings</strong>. One Problem: The Data Aren&#8217;t All There.&#8221;</p>

<p>News about the update to FAFSA is in &#8220;the business of financial aid&#8221; section below.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2018/08/congress_95_million_digital_media_kids.html">Via Education Week</a>: &#8220;Congress Considering $95 Million for Study of <strong>Technology&#8217;s Effects on Children</strong>.&#8221;</p>

<h3>(State and Local) Education Politics <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2018_icon_politics.jpg" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p><a href="https://chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2018/08/15/carranza-aims-to-speed-up-anti-bias-training-for-educators-calling-it-a-cornerstone-to-school-improvement/">Via Chalkbeat</a>: &#8220;Carranza aims to speed up <strong>anti-bias training for educators</strong>, calling it a &#8216;cornerstone&#8217; of school improvement.&#8221; (<strong>Richard Carranza</strong> is the new head of the <strong>NYC</strong> school system.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/nyregion/yeshivas-investigation-new-york.html">Via The New York Times</a>: &#8220;Three years after the city launched an investigation into whether certain ultra-<strong>Orthodox Jewish schools</strong> were providing an adequate education in secular subjects, it revealed on Thursday that it had made little progress. In a letter to the state&#8217;s Education Department seeking guidance, Richard A. Carranza, New York City schools chancellor, acknowledged that investigators had managed to visit only half the schools involved.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2018_icon_courts.jpg" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />

<p>While not directly education-related, it is worth keeping an eye &#8211; both eyes, honestly &#8211; on the <strong>FCC</strong>&#8217;s attempts to roll back consumer protections and Internet subsidies for low-income families communities. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17684460/fcc-lifeline-tribal-subsidy-change-halted-dc-court">Via The Verge</a>: &#8220;Court halts FCC plan to revoke <strong>low-income internet subsidies</strong> on tribal lands.&#8221;</p>

And that makes the mobile app pretty useless, IMHO.</p>

<h3>The &#8220;New&#8221; For-Profit Higher Ed <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2018_icon_briefcase.jpg" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>

<p>The future, in part, seems to involve renaming for-profits so they&#8217;re no longer as closely associated with a tainted brand, as we can see in this story about the &#8220;rechristened <strong>Altierus Career College</strong>&#8221; <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/Can-This-Tiny-Career-College/244264">in The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>.</p>

<p>Shocking, I know, but <strong>back-to-school</strong> means a lot of seasonal downloads for various education apps. So I&#8217;m not sure why this is news, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-08-17-more-popular-than-gmail-facebook-and-instagram-the-education-app-that-hit-1-on-the-ios-chart">via Edsurge</a>: &#8220;More Popular Than Gmail, Facebook and Instagram: The Education App That Hit #1 on the iOS Chart.&#8221; (The app in question: <strong>Remind</strong>.)</p>

<p>More important than the popularity of the ed-tech above is the scarcity of the ed-tech in this story, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/16/epipen-shortage-raises-alarm-parents-kids-head-back-school/">via The Washington Post</a>: &#8220;<strong>EpiPen</strong> shortage raises alarm for parents as kids head back to school.&#8221;</p>
