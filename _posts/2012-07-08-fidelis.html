<p>Virginia Commonwealth University professor Jon Becker recently drew the&nbsp;<a href="http://edinsanity.com/2012/07/02/you-either-love-a-good-dichotomy-or-you-dont/">diagram</a>&nbsp;below to illustrate what he identified as some of the dichotomies in our discussions about MOOCs and online higher education:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/images/onlinelearninggrid.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Content and community on the X-axis. Residential to non-residential on the Y-axis. &nbsp;I think I&rsquo;d want to add more axes too &ndash; certification, cost &ndash; but golly, I make lousy diagrams.</p>
<p>Becker&rsquo;s drawing helps highlight how most of what&rsquo;s discussed (by the press, specifically) vis-a-vis the impact of technology on higher ed involves the left-hand side: that is, how technology will impact content delivery. Take, for example, the buzz about&nbsp;<a href="http://udacity.com/">Udacity</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://coursera.com/">Coursera</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.edxonline.org/">edX</a>. (The discussions also focus on the axes I&rsquo;d add &ndash; how much college costs, the necessity of a college degree.)</p>
<p>As a result, we are overlooking a lot of other things that college provides at the other end of that X-axis: the &ldquo;community&rdquo; element that connects us to other learners, like-minded individuals, scholars, experts, colleagues, team members, recommendation-letter-writers and so on. And by extension, we largely ignore how technology could affect that. But I think there&rsquo;s plenty of opportunity &ndash; for startups and for institutions &ndash; to use technology to enhance the community side of the equation too. Online community is, of course, part of the impetus of the first&nbsp;<a href="http://mooc.ca/">connectivist MOOCs</a>. It&rsquo;s what drives&nbsp;<a href="http://ds106.us/">DS106</a>. Offline, it&rsquo;s what makes the network of a Harvard MBA so powerful too, I should add.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the things that makes&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fideliseducation.com/">Fidelis</a>&nbsp;such an interesting startup.</p>
