<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 4 in <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/">my Top 10 Trends of 2014</a> series</em></p>
<h3>MOOOOOOOOOOOOOCs!</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/05/04/ed-tech-argo-f-k-yourself">First there were MOOCs</a>. Then there were <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/03/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-moocs">MOOCs!!!111</a> Then we witnessed <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/11/29/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-moocs">the MOOC backlash</a>. Then the MOOC backlash backlash. And maybe even the MOOC backlash backlash backlash. At this point, it&rsquo;s hard to keep track.</p>
<p>As I look back on 2014 (and on 2013 and 2012 as well), I&rsquo;m not sure that MOOCs are really <em>the</em> trend we should be paying attention to here. MOOCs are a symptom, but not the disease. A better focus is probably, more broadly, on online education &ndash; on what the Internet affords teaching and learning or on the outsourcing of education technology services to third party providers. And as I noted in the <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/12/06/top-ed-tech-trends-2014-skills">previous post in this series</a>, the trend to watch may really be a re-definition of education as skills training &ndash; MOOCs have been a major part of that.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;<a href="http://www.christenseninstitute.org/moocs-aint-over/">MOOCs ain&rsquo;t over</a>&rdquo; various investors and analysts and pundits insisted this year. (I mean, no shit that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d say. Investors have pumped around $140 million into Coursera and Udacity alone.) &ldquo;<a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/05/09/moocs-disruption-only-beginning/S2VlsXpK6rzRx4DMrS4ADM/story.html">MOOCs&rsquo; disruption is only beginning</a>,&rdquo; prophesied Clayton Christensen.</p>
<p>Certainly complicit in not letting MOOCs disappear: the media, framing and reframing MOOCs as the battleground for the future of higher education. &ldquo;Will MOOCs Be Flukes?&rdquo; <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/moocs-failure-solutions">asked The New Yorker</a>. &ldquo;<a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/11/06/can-libraries-save-the-mooc.aspx">Can Libraries Save the MOOC?</a>&rdquo; Will MOOCs <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/business/business-school-disrupted.html">disrupt</a> business school? Or <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/06/04/study-moocs-wont-cannibalize-mba-programs">won&rsquo;t</a> they? &ldquo;Can MOOCs and Universities Co-Exist?&rdquo; <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303825604579515521328500810?curator=MediaREDEF">The Wall Street Journal asked in May</a>. &ldquo;Are Online Courses Democratizing Education or Killing Colleges?&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/10/28/are-online-courses-democratizing-education-or-killing-colleges/">The Wall Street Journal asked in October</a>. &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/07/how-online-courses-are-becoming-educations-new-wave/375152/">Will Free Online Courses Ever Replace a College Education?</a>&rdquo; <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/conventional-online-higher-education-will-absorb-moocs-2-reports-say/52603">Will conventional online higher ed absorb MOOCs</a>? Are MOOCs really revolutionary? <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/10/the-real-revolution-in-online-education-isnt-moocs/">Nope</a>, said the Harvard Business Review, the most trusted publication on issues of &ldquo;real revolution.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/09/free-online-classes-still-future-education/">Are MOOCs the future of education</a>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reports of MOOCs&rsquo; demise have been greatly exaggerated,&rdquo; <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/content/reports-moocs-demise-greatly-exaggerated_16836/">wrote Craig Weidemann, vice provost for online education at Penn State</a>.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s been exaggerated, for sure. Gee, I wonder how or why?</p>
<p>My favorite question about the popularity and viability of MOOCs was posed by The New York Times &ndash; you know the folks who excitedly declared 2012 &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html">The Year of the MOOCs</a>&rdquo;: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/education/edlife/demystifying-the-mooc.html">Are MOOCs overhyped</a>?</p>
<p>LOL.</p>
<h3>Not Open, Not Massive: Just Online Courses</h3>
<br />
<p>The earliest massive open online courses were &ldquo;open&rdquo; in a couple of ways. They offered open enrollment. They relied on open access and openly licensed materials and the open Web. And they were often open-ended &ndash; or at least, the learner had a great deal of agency in the connections and the knowledge they built. As such, it&rsquo;s not surprising that some of the <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2013/11/15/the-failure-of-udacity/">criticisms</a> of MOOCs that cropped up circa 2011&ndash;2012 were that these new, VC-backed versions were far from &ldquo;open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These <a href="http://moocnewsandreviews.com/ultimate-guide-to-xmoocs-and-cmoocso/">xMOOCs</a>&rsquo; already nominal &ldquo;openness&rdquo; became more and more closed this year. HarvardX MOOCs <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/10/harvardx-to-provide-online/">for Harvard alumni only</a>, for example. And despite all the glee about <a href="http://www.jconline.com/article/20140325/NEWS0501/303250039/EdX-founder-sheer-numbers-means-MOOCs-will-stay-relevant">big numbers</a>, there were even questions about whether &ldquo;<a href="http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-14/massive-online-education-gets-less-massive.html">massive</a>&rdquo; was such a good thing.</p>

<p>"Two words are wrong in &lsquo;MOOC&rsquo;: Massive and open,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/07/02/why-udacity-ceo-sebastianthrun-is-rolling-out.html?page=all">said Stanford President John Hennessy</a> in June, to which George Siemens had <a href="https://twitter.com/gsiemens/status/484386975940894720">the perfect response</a>. <em>Selectively</em> open online classes, <a href="http://labs.pearson.com/will-soocs-eat-moocs-for-breakfast/">argued Pearson SVP Amar Kumar</a>, might be preferable as they would address the question of &ldquo;unwanted diversity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unwanted diversity.&rdquo; That sorta runs counter to all the promises about MOOCs &ldquo;democratizing education,&rdquo; no? But at least it confirms Tressie McMillan Cottom&rsquo;s contention that the ideal student, as envisioned by these and other education technology efforts, is some sort of &ldquo;<a href="http://tressiemc.com/2014/07/28/democratizing-ideologies-and-inequality-regimes-berkman-center-primer/">roaming autodidact</a>&rdquo;: white, middle-class, self-motivated, male. Indeed, as Sebastian Thrun told the tech blog <a href="http://pando.com/2014/05/12/a-qa-with-godfather-of-moocs-sebastian-thrun-after-he-disavowed-his-godchild/">Pando</a> in May, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re affluent, we can do a much better job with you, we can make magic happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Magic.</p>
