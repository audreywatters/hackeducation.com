<h2>Education Politics</h2>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Education</strong> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/states-special-education-services-face-tighter-oversight-by-the-obama-administration/2014/06/23/a103031e-fb36-11e3-b1f4-8e77c632c07b_story.html">announced changes</a> to the oversight of special education programs. TL;DR: more testing.</p>
<p>The <strong>Department of Education</strong> had <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/24/5840412/the-education-department-offended-a-lot-of-people-with-a-bridesmaids">a little social media faux pas</a> this week as it tried to promote students filling out their <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtagkatie/status/481633350931599360/photo/1">FAFSA</a></strong>&nbsp;forms.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/06/charter_schools_e-rate_requests_much_higher_than_other_schools.html">According to Education Week</a>, &ldquo;Public <strong>charter schools</strong> are requesting 79 percent more per building from the federal E-rate program than traditional public schools are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Incite Agency, founded by former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs and former Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt, will lead a national public relations drive to support a series of <strong>lawsuits</strong> aimed at challenging <strong>tenure</strong>, seniority and other job protections that teachers unions have defended ferociously,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/robert-gibbs-ben-labolt-legal-fight-teachers-union-incite-agency-108243.html">says Politico</a>.</p>

<p>Rebekah Brooks, former head of <strong>News Corp</strong>&rsquo;s UK publishing unit, was found not guilty of phone hacking, bribery and perverting the course of justice.
