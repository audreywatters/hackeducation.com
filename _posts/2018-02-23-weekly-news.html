<p><em>Each week, I gather a wide variety of links to education and education technology articles. All this feeds the review I write each December on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the stories we are told</a> about the future of education.</em></p>

<p>There are stories about the school shooting in Florida and its ramifications in several sections below (and I will be the first to admit I have not gathered even close to all the links that are in circulation this week). Although the shooting is a local story, I am putting many of the articles here in the national section because, over a week later, it is still very much in the national headlines.</p>

<p><strong>President Trump</strong> has tried to blame the <strong>school shooting</strong> in <strong>Florida</strong> on everything <em>but</em> guns. On <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/3503/trump-video-games-violence-parkland?zd=2&amp;zi=vmjnsrp5"><strong>video games</strong></a>, for example &#8211; yes, that old canard.
