<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/us/politics/arne-duncan.html">announced</a> that he will step down in December. (President Obama will reportedly nominate John King as his replacement.)</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, Duncan proposed a &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2015/09/30/education-secretary-to-urge-criminal-justice-reform-wants-15-billion-to-go-to-teachers/">prison-to-school pipeline</a>,&#8221; reducing the number of people incarcerated for non-violent crimes and using the money saved for pay raises for teachers in high poverty schools.</p>

<p>The Department of Education will give <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/charter-love-feds-give-157-million-to-expand-charter-schools/2015/09/28/006ad118-6613-11e5-8325-a42b5a459b1e_story.html">$157 million</a> to create new charter schools, &#8220;despite criticisms by its inspector general in the past that the agency has done a poor job of overseeing federal dollars sent to charter schools.&#8221; (Meanwhile, &#8220;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/10/why-dont-suburbanites-want-charter-schools/408307/">Why Donâ€™t Suburbanites Want Charter Schools?</a>&#8221;)</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/10/01/appeals-court-ruling-obannon-case-mixed-bag-ncaa-athletes">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Wednesday upheld a lower court&#8217;s opinion that National Collegiate Athletic Association rules to limit what college athletes can be paid violate antitrust laws. But the appeals court also tossed out a federal judge's requirement that the NCAA allow athletes to receive deferred compensation of up to $5,000 per year.&#8221; More on the decision <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/233525/">via The Chronicle of Higher Education</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/sports/obannon-ncaa-case-court-of-appeals-ruling.html">The New York Times</a>.</p>

<p>A federal judge has ruled that &#8220;students who experience traumatic events while growing up in poor, turbulent neighborhoods could be considered disabled,&#8221; <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/01/445001579/ruling-in-compton-schools-case-trauma-could-cause-disability">NPR reports</a>. The ruling comes as part of a class action lawsuit against the Compton School District. (The judge also denied the plaintiffs&#8217; request for class action status.) </p>

<p>&#8220;Seattle will take several steps to make the ed-tech used in its schools accessible to blind students, faculty, and parents, in the settlement of a lawsuit brought against the district by Noel Nightingale and her co-plaintiff, the National Federation of the Blind,&#8221; <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2015/09/ed-tech_accessibility_lawsuit_settled_by_seattle_district_advocates_for_blind.html">reports Education Week</a>. A statement from the National Federation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This landmark agreement with the Seattle Public Schools should serve as a model for the nation and should put school districts on notice that we can no longer wait to have equal education for blind students and to have access to information, use of school services, and full participation in school activities by blind faculty, personnel, and parents</p>
</blockquote>
