<h2>The State of the Union is&hellip;</h2>
<p><strong>President Obama</strong> delivered the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamas-2014-state-of-the-union-address-full-text/"><strong>State of the Union</strong> address</a> Tuesday night, and the fifth word was &ldquo;teacher.&rdquo; So I guess we can forgive him for all his administration&rsquo;s horrid education policies now. (<a href="http://blogs.seattletimes.com/educationlab/2014/01/28/education-highlights-from-obamas-state-of-the-union-address/">Here&rsquo;s a closer look at the speech&rsquo;s &ldquo;education highlights.&rdquo;</a>)</p>
<h2>In Other Political News&hellip;</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/31/obama-becomes-latest-politician-criticize-liberal-arts-discipline">It&rsquo;s <strong>Obama</strong> versus Art History majors</a>.</p>
<p>A report from the House Education and the Workforce Committee examines the working conditions of <strong>adjunct labor</strong> in higher education. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/24/house-committee-report-highlights-plight-adjunct-professors">More via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p>In a story perfectly written to outrage the Silicon Valley libertarian set, &ldquo;California regulator seeks to shut down &lsquo;<strong>learn to code</strong>&rsquo; bootcamps&rdquo; <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/01/29/california-regulator-seeks-to-shut-down-learn-to-code-bootcamps/">writes Venture Beat</a>. There are rules surrounding academic and vocational training programs, but rules, schmules! Who cares why these might be in place! Disrupt! Disrupt! Disrupt!</p>
<h2>Winter Weather in the US</h2>
<p><strong>Bad weather</strong> means I&rsquo;m typing up this week&rsquo;s round-up of education news from Hermosa Beach and not from <strong>Atlanta</strong>, where I was scheduled to speak at Emory University&rsquo;s <a href="http://ewprogram.com/incubator/">Domain of One&rsquo;s Own Incubator</a>.</p>
<p>At one point, <a href="http://www.weather.com/news/snow-leaves-atlanta-schools-struggling-respond-20140128">some 10,000 <strong>Atlanta</strong> schoolchildren</a> were stranded at school by the storm, and thousands had to spend the night there.</p>
<p>(For those keeping score at home, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/01/map-how-much-snow-it-typically-takes-to-cancel-school-in-the-us/283470/">here&rsquo;s a map</a> of how much <strong>snow</strong> it typically takes to cancel school in the US.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/regajha/after-being-denied-a-snow-day-university-of-illinois-student">The students at <strong>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</strong></a> took to Twitter to complain when they didn&rsquo;t get a snow-day. Oh. And to be utterly racist and sexist to University Chancellor Phyllis Wise.</p>
<h2>And In Other Mind-bogglingly Awful American Campus News&hellip;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;As many as 40 students at <strong>Uintah Elementary</strong> in Salt Lake City had their lunches&mdash;which they&rsquo;d already received from the cafeteria&mdash;seized and trashed by school authorities because their parents were behind on payments,&rdquo; <a href="http://gawker.com/elementary-school-in-utah-seizes-lunches-from-40-studen-1512340825">writes Gawker</a>. <a href="http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_268743/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=kQB44S8p">The school district says it&rsquo;s sorry</a>.</p>
<h2>Meanwhile, in New Zealand&hellip;</h2>
<p><a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/school-ditches-rules-and-loses-bullies-5807957">Getting ride of the playground rules</a> altogether at <strong>Swanson Primary School</strong> has meant &ldquo;a drop in bullying, serious injuries and vandalism, while concentration levels in class are increasing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCs</h2>
<p>News broke this week (first via <a href="http://www.wamda.com/2014/01/coursera-blocks-syria-and-iran-moocs-online-courses">Wamda</a>, I think) that <strong>Coursera</strong> and <strong>Udacity</strong> are <a href="http://help.coursera.org/customer/portal/articles/1425714-why-is-my-country-blocked-">blocked</a> in <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong>Cuba</strong>, <strong>Sudan</strong>, and <strong>Iran</strong>. Apparently MOOCs <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/coursera-udacity-edx-blocked-syria-iran/">violate US export policy</a> for these countries (because MOOCs are content delivery?). I guess there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/01/coursera_us_government_blocks.html">some paperwork that needs to be filed</a> in order to rectify this (<strong>edX</strong> has done this apparently). Funny that Coursera has <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/65596539008/introducing-coursera-learning-hubs-global">partnered with the State Department for Learning Hubs</a> all over the world but didn&rsquo;t know about these export policy rules. Didn&rsquo;t read the Terms of Service or something, I reckon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Coursera</strong> <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/74991093111/expanding-learning-in-latin-america-with-the-carlos">has formed a partnership</a> with the <strong>Carlos Slim Foundation</strong> (which has also partnered and funded <strong>Khan Academy</strong>) &ldquo;to improve access to education among Spanish speaking students around the world, as well as support opportunities for career development and employment throughout Latin America.&rdquo; No word in the Coursera announcement if there is funding attached to this partnership.</p>
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/san-jose-state-u-adopts-more-edx-content-for-outsourcing-trial/49905"><strong>San Jose State</strong> plans to outsource more of its courses to <strong>edX</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>For-profit <strong>Bridgepoint Education</strong>&rsquo;s Ashford University will let students take certain <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/quickwire-for-profit-university-will-accept-mooc-credits/49805">MOOC classes for credit</a>.</p>
<p>But <strong>Stanford</strong> economist Caroline Hoxby says that &ldquo;<a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/stanford-economist-elite-colleges-should-not-give-credit-for-moocs/49811">Elite Colleges Should Not Give Credit for MOOCs</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(I love those three items side-by-side. Speaks volumes about the state of higher ed today, no?)</p>
<h2>Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Desmos</strong>, the free, online graphing calculator of awesomeness, has unveiled <a href="https://class.desmos.com/carnival">Function Carnival</a>. <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=18420">Here&rsquo;s Dan Meyer&rsquo;s explanation</a> of the project and how it helps address students&rsquo; misconceptions of graphing functions (he and Christopher Danielson worked with Desmos to create this).</p>
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/u-of-california-at-davis-partners-with-amazon-to-create-online-storefront/49887"><strong>UC Davis</strong> is testing a university-branded <strong>Amazon.com</strong> storefront</a> that will give 2% of each sale back to the university. (That seems super low compared to the <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/join/compensation.html">typical affiliate marketing rates at Amazon</a>. Davis must&rsquo;ve got the &ldquo;special deal&rdquo; wink wink.) <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/31/amazon-college-bookstore-uc-davis/">It&rsquo;s the end of the college bookstore as we know it, Techcrunch predictably predicts</a>.</p>
<p>Because you just can&rsquo;t have too many education non-profits funding by the Gates and Carnegie Foundations (I guess): the <strong>Digital Learning Institute</strong> (<a href="http://www.digitallearninginstitute.org/">DigiLEARN</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> unveiled &ldquo;<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/chrome-lego-you-can-build-whatever-you.html">Build with Chrome</a>,&rdquo; a collaboration between its Chrome browser and <strong>Lego</strong>. &ldquo;To hone your engineering skills and prepare for the upcoming &ldquo;THE LEGO&reg; MOVIE&trade;,&rdquo; you can explore the Build Academy, a series of short tutorials and challenges featuring characters and structures from the film.&rdquo; Ugh.</p>
<p>At FETC, <strong>Google</strong> also <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2014/01/google-for-education-kicking-off-2014.html">announced</a> several new education products: &ldquo;K&ndash;12 Books in Google Play for Education,&rdquo; some new Chromebooks, and some new tablets.</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/01/29/blackboard-developing-new-online-bookstore-right-in-the-lms.aspx"><strong>Blackboard</strong> is developing a &ldquo;virtual bookstore&rdquo; within its LMS</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>Library of Congress</strong> launched a new collection called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.loc.gov/collection/finding-our-place-in-the-cosmos-with-carl-sagan/about-this-collection/">Finding Our Place in the Cosmos: From Galileo to Sagan and Beyond</a>,&rdquo; which includes a number of resources that point to how <strong>Carl Sagan</strong> became interested in science.</p>
<p><strong>Lumen Learning</strong> and <strong>OpenStax</strong> <a href="http://www.lumenlearning.com/openstax">announced</a> a partnership that would mean the latter&rsquo;s free textbooks are combined with the former&rsquo;s support services &ldquo;to help higher education institutions and faculty members successfully transition to using readily available &lsquo;open-educational resources&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>The <strong>American Library Association</strong> announced its <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-library-association-announces-2014-youth-media-award-winners-242205611.html">annual awards for children&rsquo;s and youth literature</a>.

The cost of the tablets that will be used on new state tests will be about $200 less per device, although the computers won&rsquo;t include curriculum. The revised price will be $504, compared to $699 for the iPads with curriculum. With taxes and other fees, the full cost of the more fully equipped devices rises to $768.&rdquo;</p>

The <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-28/latest-headache-for-ncaa-inc-college-football-players-want-to-unionize">NCAA says</a> the move "serves to undermine the purpose of college: an education." HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p>The <strong>Joan Ganz Cooney Center</strong> released a report this week: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/publication/learning-at-home/">Learning at Home: Families&rsquo; Educational Media Use in America</a>.&rdquo; Among the findings: &ldquo;children spend far more time with educational TV (an average of :42 a day) than they do with educational content on other platforms such as mobile devices (:05), computers (:05), or video games (:03).&rdquo;</p>
