<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>This week's podcast was a short one -- having Independence Day fall in the middle of the week made for a slow news week. Slow, except for the <a href="/2012/07/06/hack-education-weekly-news-7-6-2012/">news</a> about the Higgs Boson particle, a proposal for a "bar exam" for teachers, more NCLB waivers, the end to the "gainful employment" rule, LOLs over MTT3K-style satire, concerns over badges and certification, and more.</p>
<p>The link to the MP3 of the show is below, and/or you can subscribe to  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/edtechlive/hackeducation">the podcast feed</a>. You can also find the podcast in iTunes, as part of Steve's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/edtechlive/id219875737">EdTechLive series</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And while it's not really new news, I'm not sure I've ever promoted my new newsletter here. &nbsp;You can sign up <a href="http://hackeducation.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0ab07657df870af8eb101b4e5&amp;id=b9dca72f6c">here</a> for a weekly email from me that provides my take on the news and trends in education.</p>
