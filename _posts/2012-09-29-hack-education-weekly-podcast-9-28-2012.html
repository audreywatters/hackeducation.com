<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. Apologies (once again!) for the quality of this recording. This time, it's the fault of Google Voice and Verizon -- the former is responsible for no Internet at Steve's location; the latter for the poor sound quality of our conversation. Ah, technology.</p>
<p>This week, Steve and I discuss <a href="/2012/09/23/what-educators-need-to-know-about-tech/">what educators should know about Silicon Valley</a>, as well as my continuing struggles to fit the square peg of Hack Education into the round hole of <a href="/2012/09/26/ed-startup-101-week-5/">Ed Startup 101</a>. That particular discussion has prompted Steve to write about this over on his own blog too: &nbsp;"<a href="http://www.stevehargadon.com/2012/09/reframing-ed-tech-ventures-from-pain.html">Reframing Ed-Tech Ventures: From the 'Pain Test' to 'Value.'</a>"</p>
<p>The link to the MP3 of the latest episode of our show is below, and/or you can subscribe to  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/edtechlive/hackeducation">the podcast feed</a>. You can also find the podcast in iTunes, as part of Steve's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/edtechlive/id219875737">EdTechLive series</a>.</p>
