<p><a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2011/01/julia-meets-html-5.html">Google Labs</a> has just launched <a href="http://juliamap.googlelabs.com/">Julia Map</a>, an app that renders fractals in your browser using HTML5.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">Julia sets</a> are fractals that were studied by the French mathematician Gaston Julia in the 1920s.  Some fifty years later, Benoï¿½t Mandelbrot studied one of these sets (z2 - c) and popularized it by generating the first computer visualization (and of course coining the term fractal).</p>
<p>The generation of fractals requires heavy computational resources, but now browsers have optimized JavaScript up to the point where you can render some fractal sets almost instantly in a browser.  And that's precisely what Julia Map aims to do.</p>
<p>It uses the Google Maps API to zoom and pan into the fractals.  The images are computed with HTML 5 canvas.  According to Google, Each image generally requires millions of floating point operations. <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/">Web workers</a> spread the heavy calculations on all cores of the machine.</p>
<p>Google asks people to use the hashtag #juliamap to show off the images you've discovered if you tweet them out.  Whether you opt to share your fractals or not, it's a pretty fun new tool.</p>
