<p>The <a href="http://www.ewa.org/site/">Education Writers Association</a> just held its national conference the past few days in New Orleans.  I didn't go.  I didn't really consider it, honestly.  I see myself as an education <em>technology</em> writer, not an education one.</p>
<p>Maybe that's a distinction that's purely in my head, as it's pretty hard to write about ed-tech and not focus on the education aspect -- not just the teaching and learning, but the politics, the policies, and the funding too.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's a strange distinction that plagues newsrooms everywhere, so you end up, for example, with the Style Editor from The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/education/06online.html">covering K-12 online learning</a>.  (The Style section is typically where the NYT puts its "teens and social media" stories -- not in the technology section, and not in the education section.)</p>
<p>It's a struggle exemplified in the fact that one of the nation's most important dailies, The Washington Post, owns (and actually profits from -- unlike the newspaper) one of the world's largest educational companies, Kaplan Higher Ed.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-trials-of-kaplan-higher-ed-and-the-education-of-the-washington-post-co/2011/03/20/AFsGuUAD_story.html">Read this story</a> about the relationship between the WaPo and Kaplan (and the federal government), and then tell me how journalists there can really adequately address education and/or education technology with any sort of critical eye.</p>
<p>It's reflected in <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/teachers-investigation/">The LA Times "value added" analysis</a> -- an attempt at data journalism that is so deeply mired in the politics of education and education reform that few people are asking difficult questions about the technology involved -- not just in the standardized testing, but in the actual data and algorithms that the paper has utilized in its investigations.</p>
<p>The flip-side of this, of course, is the paltry coverage that technology publications give to education.  Education and ed-tech go uncovered, for the most part.  (I know, I know.  I rage about that all the time.)  One exception:  Bad Teachers on Facebook:  teachers saying mean things, teachers posting mean photos, teachers with alcohol.   Teachers Gone Wild!!!  Education plus technology, these stories scream, is a dangerous, dangerous thing.</p>
<p>No surprise, then -- back to the inextricability of education, technology, and politics -- you get more and more districts moving to crack down on <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/10/teachers-social-networking_n_846340.html">schools' access to social media</a> -- not just students' access.  Teachers' access.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2011/0329_education_news.aspx">Brookings Institute</a> study found that Americans want more media coverage of education.   "Hooray!" was my first reaction.  "I'll be able to find work!" I thought.  But then I paused.  More coverage of what?  Students' test scores?  Teacher performance?</p>
<p>But more coverage of education technology?  Sadly, I don't think anyone asked that question.</p>
