<h2>What is &ldquo;Adaptive Technology&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Adaptive  software&rdquo; is often named as one of the &ldquo;hot new trends&rdquo; in education  technology. But adaptive learning is hardly new. Its roots date back  decades, to the &ldquo;intelligent tutoring systems&rdquo; of the 1960s and 1970s  when there was, much like we&rsquo;re starting to see again today, a growing  interest in using artificial intelligence and &ldquo;big data&rdquo; to build  educational software.</p>
<div class="pullquote">The promise of adaptive  learning technology: to adapt to each individual student&rsquo;s needs and  skill level, ideally to help them learn more effectively and more  efficiently.</div>
<p>The goal &ndash; and the promise &ndash; of adaptive learning  technology: to adapt to each individual student&rsquo;s needs and skill level,  ideally to help them learn more effectively and more efficiently.</p>
<p>The  term &ldquo;adaptive&rdquo; actually covers a number of characteristics in software  (indeed, the term is applied quite liberally in marketing new tools).  Traditionally, adaptive learning tools focus on the following components  (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100331014042/http://www.ejel.org/volume-2/vol2-issue1/issue1-art11-paramythis.pdf">PDF</a>):  &ldquo;monitoring the activities of its users; interpreting these on the  basis of domain-specific models; inferring user requirements and  preferences out of the interpreted activities, appropriately  representing these in associated models; and, finally, acting upon the  available knowledge on its users and the subject matter at hand, to  dynamically facilitate the learning process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words,  adaptive software focuses on the domain &ndash; the information that&rsquo;s  supposed to be taught; on the student&rsquo;s responses &ndash; often using &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_Theorem">bayesian algorithms</a>&rdquo;  to determine the likelihood of a student getting the next question  right or wrong; and on the instruction &ndash; what sorts of hints or feedback  a student might need to move forward.</p>
<h2>Who&rsquo;s Developing &ldquo;Adaptive Technology&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>There  are many companies building adaptive learning technologies, and more  integrating &ldquo;adaptivity&rdquo; into their offerings. Textbook publishers and  learning management system-makers have made significant moves into the  sector recently, acquiring and/or partnering with adaptive learning  startups.</p>
<p>A few of the major players (this is by no means an exhaustive list):</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Knewton</span>:  The self-described leader in adaptive learning, Knewton has partnered  with (and received investment from) many of the major textbook  publishers, including Pearson, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and Macmillan  Education. Like several other companies who offer adaptive technologies,  Knewton was originally a test-prep company. Knewton has raised <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/knewton">over $100 million</a> in venture capital.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">McGraw-Hill Education</span>:  the publisher acquired the ALEKS Corporation last year, well known for  its math software, and Area9, a Danish adaptive technology developer.  The company&rsquo;s new digital textbook platform Smartbook boasts adaptivity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desire2Learn</span>:  The learning management system acquired several "adaptive" startups  last year, including Knowillage Systems and Degree Compass. Knowillage  has built an adaptive learning system that maps &ldquo;learning paths&rdquo; based  on students&rsquo; skills. Degree Compass makes course recommendations to  students based on their interests and previous course success.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dreambox Learning</span>: Dreambox makes adaptive software for the elementary level. Dreambox has raised <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dreambox-learning">over $35 million</a> in funding, much of it from Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Open Learning Initiative</span>:  The OLI is based at Carnegie Mellon University (where the Carnegie  Learning company, and its Cognitive Tutor software originated decades  ago). This is a research-focused effort to build university-level online  courses around that cognitive tutor model.</p>
<h2>What Does the Research Say?</h2>
<p>The  hype surrounding these tools gets louder and louder &ndash; no surprise since  they dovetail with other pressures we&rsquo;re seeing in education and  ed-tech right now: a push for more computer usage, a desire for  &ldquo;data-driven&rdquo; decision making in education, a &ldquo;refresh&rdquo; of traditional  textbooks and assessments through digitization. The promise: adaptive  technologies will make learning more effective and more &ldquo;personalized&rdquo;  (Later this week, I&rsquo;ll look more closely at that buzzword.)</p>
<p>But what does the research say? The Gates Foundation sponsored a report (<a href="http://edgrowthadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Learning-to-Adapt_Report_Supplier-Landscape_Education-Growth-Advisors_April-2013.pdf">PDF</a>),  published last year, that detailed the &ldquo;supplier landscape,&rdquo; including  &ldquo;evidence of outcomes.&rdquo; Yet despite all the excitement about the  potential for adaptive software, this report makes it clear: the jury is  still out. There&rsquo;s just not a lot of statistically significant evidence  or peer reviewed research here.</p>
<p>The Carnegie Mellon University  OLI may be the exception that proves the rule &ndash; it has a decade of  research that drives its development. Research, not markets. <a href="https://oli.cmu.edu/get-to-know-oli/see-our-proven-results/">Independent studies</a> have found that students in the OLI statistics course, for example,  perform as well as students in traditional instructor-led courses.</p>
<p>The US Department of Education&rsquo;s &ldquo;What Works Clearinghouse&rdquo; has reviewed other adaptive software too. Among the findings: &ldquo;<a href="http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=627">DreamBox Learning was found to have potentially positive effects on mathematics achievement for elementary school students</a>.&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href="http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=88">Carnegie  Learning Curricula and Cognitive Tutor was found to have mixed effects  on mathematics achievement for high school students</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>What Questions Should We Ask?</h2>
<p>Certainly one of the most important questions we should ask about education technology is "does it work?" <em>But we need to ask too what we even mean when we ask that question</em>.  Are we only interested in tools that raise test scores, for example? Is  that what adaptive technology means when it claims to be "effective"?</p>
<p>And what does it mean to focus on "efficiency"? Why is this a goal? (For whom is this a goal?)</p>
<p>Does  a data-driven "learning path" circumscribe certain possibilities for  learning? Does this software merely reshuffle the instruction of  traditional concepts through traditional means, just updated with newer  algorithms?</p>
<p>Who benefits from using adaptive software? How can it be used in progressive education, in a project-based classroom? Can it?</p>
