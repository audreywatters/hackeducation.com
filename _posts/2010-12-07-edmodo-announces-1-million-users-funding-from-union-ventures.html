<p>Social learning network <a href="http://www.edmodo.com">Edmodo</a> made a couple of exciting <a href="http://blog.edmodo.com/2010/12/07/welcome-union-square-ventures-to-the-edmodo-team/">announcements</a> today.  In addition to touting all the new features it's rolled out recently, the company says it has exceeded 1 million registered users in over 17,000 schools.</p>
<p>Edmodo is a free social network for schools, teachers, and students that provides a secure platform for communication.  Assignments, photos, videos, links, blogs, and updates can all be shared via the site.</p>
<p>The company also announced today that it's received investment from one of the leading investment firms in the country, Union Square Ventures - early investors in Twitter, Foursquare, and Etsy.</p>
<p>Union Square Ventures partner <a href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com/2010/12/edmodo.php">Albert Wenger</a> wrote a blog post about the investment today, noting the firm's commitment to "<a href="http://publicusv.wiki.zoho.com/Hacking-Education.html">hack education</a>" (which, of course, I love).  Wenger pointed to 3 things that interest the firm in terms of investment opportunities in education and Internet technologies:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>educational content in "micro-chunks"</li>
<li>decentralized decision-making</li>
<li>mobile learning</li>
</ol>
<p>Wenger says that Edmodo shares these beliefs as it offers a way for students and teachers to easily share content - with an emphasis on both the social and the mobile experience.</p>
