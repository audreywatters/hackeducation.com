<p>Voting is now open for the <a href="http://edublogawards.com/">2010 Edublog Awards</a>. There are over 20 categories, with well over 300 blogs nominated across them.</p>
<p>I am honored that Hack Education has been nominated in the "<a href="http://edublogawards.com/2010awards/best-new-edublog-2010/">Best New Blog</a>" category.  While of course I'd love your vote, I recommend you visit the site if for no other reason than to check out all the nominees, as there are a bunch of amazing blogs, podcasts, and educators you should pay attention to.</p>
