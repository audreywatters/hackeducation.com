<p>Arguably, those who believe a public library is simply a repository of print books haven&rsquo;t been to a public library lately. Here at MindShift, we&rsquo;ve been covering the ways in which the library is evolving to change the demands of digital technologies and of its patrons: libraries are becoming&nbsp;<a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/11/libraries-and-museums-set-to-become-hands-on-learning-labs/">learning labs</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2012/01/creating-the-library-of-tomorrow-from-the-ground-up/">innovation centers</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/11/the-public-library-completely-reimagined/">makerspaces</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the public library has always been a community center as much as a place to go to check out books to read, so the new extensions of the library&rsquo;s service may not be so far afield from the institution&rsquo;s mission to provide access to information. Even so, much of the emphasis has been on literacy &mdash; reading and writing, digital and analog &mdash; and not on other forms of creativity.</p>
<p>But three graduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Library and Information Studies have launched a project that points to another important way in which libraries play a key role in their communities. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.libraryasincubatorproject.org/">Library as Incubator Project</a>&nbsp;highlights some of the ways in which libraries and local artists can work together.</p>
