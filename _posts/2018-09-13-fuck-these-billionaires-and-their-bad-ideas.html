<p>A year ago, the richest man in the world <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/875418348598603776">asked Twitter</a> for suggestions on how he should spend his money. And today, Jeff Bezos unveiled a few more details about his plans &#8211; <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-interview-axel-springer-ceo-amazon-trump-blue-origin-family-regulation-washington-post-2018-4">other than funding space travel</a>, that is. His new philanthropic effort, <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1040253796293795842">The Day 1 Fund</a>, will finance two initiatives: the Families Fund will work with existing organizations to address homelessness and hunger; and the Academies fund &#8220;will launch an operate a network of high-quality, full-scholarship, Montessori-inspired preschools in underserved communities.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll use the same set of principles that have driven Amazon,&#8221; Bezos wrote in a note posted to Twitter. &#8220;Most important among these will be genuine intense customer obsession. The child will be the customer.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>The child will be the customer</em>.</p>

<p>Bezos then went on to cite a phrase that is so often misquoted and misattributed in those shiny, happy motivational PowerPoint slides &#8211; you know the ones &#8211; that people like to post to social media: &#8220;Education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire.&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleForEdu/status/1027322562416717825">W. B. Yeats never said this</a>, for the record, but words get so easily twisted, history so easily co-opted.</p>

<p>The assurance that &#8220;the child will be the customer&#8221; underscores the belief &#8211; shared by many in and out of education reform and education technology &#8211; that education is simply a transaction: an individual&#8217;s decision-making in a &#8220;marketplace of ideas.&#8221; (There is no community, no public responsibility, no larger civic impulse for early childhood education here. It&#8217;s all about <em>private</em> schools offering <em>private</em>, individual benefits.) </p>

<p>This idea that &#8220;the child will be the customer&#8221; is, of course, also a nod to &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; as well, as is the invocation of a &#8220;Montessori-inspired&#8221; model. As the customer, the child will be tracked and analyzed, her preferences noted so as to make better recommendations to up-sell her on the most suitable products. And if nothing else, Montessori education in the United States is full of product recommendations. </p>

<p>There&#8217;s another piece to all this, not mentioned in Bezos&#8217;s note about building a chain of preschools that &#8220;use the same set of principles that have driven Amazon&#8221;: Amazon&#8217;s own labor practices. The online retail giant is a notoriously terrible place to work &#8211; the pay, particularly in the warehouses is so low that <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/146540/amazon-thriving-thanks-taxpayer-dollars">many employees receive government assistance</a>. The working conditions are dangerous and dehumanizing. &#8220;Amazon has patented a system that would put workers in a cage, on top of a robot,&#8221; read the headline <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-has-patented-a-system-that-would-put-workers-in-a-cage-on-top-of-a-robot/">in last week&#8217;s Seattle Times</a>. And it&#8217;s not so great for the white collar workers either. &#8220;Nearly every person I worked with, I saw cry at their desk,&#8221; one employee in books marketing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html">told The New York Times back in 2015</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of the early childhood educators in the US are already very poorly paid; many preschools have incredibly high turnover rates. As research has demonstrated that preschool has a lasting positive effect on children&#8217;s educational attainment, there have been many efforts to &#8220;raise the standards,&#8221; demanding for example that preschools be staffed by more qualified teachers. But the demand, in turn, for more training and certification hasn&#8217;t brought with it better pay or benefits. The median pay for preschool teachers, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/preschool-teachers.htm">according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, is less than $30,000 a year. Even those with Bachelor&#8217;s degrees earn only about <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/earlylearning/files/ece-low-compensation-undermines-quality-report-2016.pdf">$14.70 an hour</a>, about half of the average wages for all those with the same level of education. </p>

<p>This is a field in which <a href="https://hechingerreport.org/who-should-pay-for-preschool/">a third of employees</a> already qualify for government assistance. And now Jeff Bezos wants to step in &#8211; not as a taxpayer, oh no, but as a philanthropist.</p>

<p>And he&#8217;s not alone. Early childhood education has received quite a bit of attention from ed-tech investors in recent years. Three companies have raised venture capital to help people run preschools and childcare facilities in their homes so far this year: Wonderschool, WeeCare, and Procare Software. Last year, VCs poured millions into Tinkergarten, Sawyer, and Kinedu. Investors in these startups include some of the &#8220;big money&#8221; names in Silicon Valley: Omidyar Network, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Andreessen Horowitz, among others. (One of these companies, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/weecare-raises-4-2m-to-help-parents-balance-career-and-family/">WeeCare</a>, says it&#8217;s also planning to train and license childcare providers, and it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me to see the micro-certificate, only education, nanodegree folks also jump on this bandwagon. &#8220;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/03/30/driverless">Uber for Education</a>&#8221; or something.)</p>

<p>Ostensibly, there&#8217;s no shortage of potential &#8220;customers&#8221; for these private school software startups &#8211; the demand for childcare is high, and many families live in <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2016/10/27/225703/child-care-deserts/">what the Center for American Progress has called</a> &#8220;child care deserts,&#8221; that is places where there are no options for affordable, high-quality early childhood education. </p>

<p>But are private preschool chains really the path we want to pursue, particularly if we recognize that early childhood education is so incredibly crucial? Can the gig economy and the algorithm ever provide high quality preschool? For all the flaws in the public school system, it&#8217;s important to remember: there is no accountability in billionaires&#8217; educational philanthropy. </p>

<p>And, as W. B. Yeats never once said, charity is no substitute for justice. </p>
