<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>We recorded this week's episode via Blackboard Collaborate (a move away from Skype which has become increasingly unreliable). Perhaps it will allow us to incorporate video, chat and so on.</p>
<p>In this week's podcast, Steve and I discuss <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/25/apple-q3/">Apple's quarterly earnings report</a> and the popularity of Apple products in schools; <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/30/july-2012-apps/">Rovio's latest app Amazing Alex</a>; and the importance of <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/08/02/education-theorists/">education theory</a> and <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/08/03/ldt-expo-2012-storified/">research</a>.</p>
