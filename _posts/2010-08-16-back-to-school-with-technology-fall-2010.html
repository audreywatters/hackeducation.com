<p>I posted my most anticipated back-to-school tech tool list today on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/teachers_pick_their_top_5_back-to-school_tech_tool.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>.  According to those who took my survey, teachers are most looking forward to bringing the following into the classroom this fall:  iPads, Twitter, Google Apps for Education, and blogs.</p>
<p>I thought the results of the survey were interesting.  There was lots of variation and most of the tools were only mentioned once.</p>
<p>I was also curious to see certain companies' products and services go unmentioned.  Perhaps they just don't fall into the "new" category.  Perhaps people aren't really using them.  Perhaps I need more data.</p>
<p>And of course the question you ask can shape the results you get, and I did ask for a tool a teacher wanted to "take into the classroom."  So perhaps that explains the absence of administrative tools from the list.  Or perhaps no one is looking forward to a new LMS.</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about what it takes to "hack education," and today's post was just the first in a number that I'm writing for back-to-school.</p>
