<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 3 of my <a href="http://2012trends.hackeducation.com">Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2012</a> series</em></p>

<h3>Code Year</h3>
<br />

<p>It was sheer marketing genius: the announcement on January 1 by the learn-to-program startup <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> that 2012 should be &ldquo;<a href="http://codeyear.com">Code Year</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an initiative timed with the making of New Year&rsquo;s resolutions (and timed too to coincide with a narrative about <a href="http://www.newgeography.com/content/002630-the-hardest-job-to-fill-in-2012-a-look-at-the-supply-web-developers">a shortage of programmers</a>), Codecademy encouraged people to make this the year they learned to program. Sign up for an email newsletter, the startup said, and it would send you one a lesson from the Codeacademy site per week for the entire year. And some 400,000 folks took them up on the offer, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p>

<p><br />Code Year earned Codecademy a lot of press. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/01/learn_to_program_make_a_free_weekly_coding_lesson_your_new_year_s_resolution_.html">Slate</a>. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/01/code-year.html">The New Yorker</a>. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/06/technology/code_year/index.htm">CNN</a>. <a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/coding-start-ups-compete-for-booming-market/">The New York Times</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/01/new-years-resolution-programming/">Techcrunch</a>. <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/03/codeacademy-code-year/">Mashable</a>. And the startup parlayed the buzz into a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/06/19/codecademy-10-mill-from-the-spaceman-himself/">$10 million Series B funding round</a> in August, also expanding its lessons into other languages beyond its initial Javascript tutorials.</p>

<p>Despite the excitement from the tech press and investors, many of <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/10/28/codecademy-and-the-future-of-not-learning-to-code">my concerns</a> about the effectiveness of Codecademy remain. (My post&nbsp;from its Series A round of funding last year where I detail these concerns remains the most trafficked post on Hack Education.) Has Codecademy successfully taught people to program this year? 400,000 sign-ups in January is one measurement of success, to be sure; but it doesn't seem like the most important one here (hint: it's more to do with learning outcomes come December.)</p>

<p>And if nothing else, traffic to the Codecademy site suggests that, like most New Year&rsquo;s resolutions, some of the initial excitement about Code Year quickly died off.</p>
