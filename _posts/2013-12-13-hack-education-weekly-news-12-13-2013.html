<h2>The "Hour of Code"</h2>
<p><a href="http://code.org/">According to <strong>Code.org</strong></a>, the organization that&rsquo;s spearheaded this week&rsquo;s push to teach more students computer science, over 13.7 million students have &ldquo;learned an hour of code&rdquo; this week.</p>
<p><strong>Chicago Public Schools</strong> <a href="http://my.chicagotribune.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-78485515/">says</a> it will add computer science as a core subject, instead of an elective, in the city&rsquo;s high schools.</p>
<p>Timed with this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hour of Code,&rdquo; <strong>Codecademy</strong> has <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/12/09/codecademys-new-mobile-app-gets-users-into-the-hour-of-code/">launched</a> an iOS app: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecademy-hour-of-code/id762950096?ls=1&amp;mt=">Codecademy: Hour of Code</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps not timed with this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hour of Code,&rdquo; Change the Equation <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2013/12/panel_discussion_examines_gend.html">reports</a> that <strong>women earned just 18% of CS degrees</strong> in 2012, down from 27% about a decade earlier.</p>
<h2>Pearson's Big News Week</h2>
<p><strong>The Pearson Foundation</strong>, the &ldquo;charitable arm&rdquo; of the largest education company in the world, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/nyregion/educational-publishers-charity-accused-of-seeking-profits-will-pay-millions.html">will pay $7.7 million</a> to settle an investigation that &ldquo;it repeatedly broke New York State law by assisting in for-profit ventures&rdquo; surrounding the publisher's creation of Common Core-related textbooks and software.</p>
<p>Faculty in <strong>Rutgers University</strong>&rsquo;s School of Arts and Sciences join those in the Graduate School in <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/13/rutgers-u-liberal-arts-and-science-faculty-join-graduate-school-pearson-boycott">voting to block any programs</a> that the university tries to outsource to <strong>Pearson</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson</strong> has <a href="http://www.pearsoned.com/edtech-startups-graduate-from-the-pearson-catalyst-for-education-accelerator-program-with-first-class-honors/#.UqtlXWRDuRx">graduated</a> the first cohort from its startup accelerator program. Those startups: ClassOwl, Spongelab, Actively Learn, Ace Learning and VLinks Media.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson</strong> <a href="http://www.pearson.com/news/2013/december/pearson-announcesfurtherinvestment.html">says</a> it&rsquo;s invested in India&rsquo;s <strong>Avanti Learning Centres</strong>, which help low-income students prepare for college exams. It&rsquo;s the second time Pearson has invested in the centres since 2012.</p>
<h2>Publishing and Copyright Battles</h2>
<p>The Chronicle of Higher Education&rsquo;s Jennifer Howard <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/posting-your-latest-article-you-might-have-to-take-it-down/48865">examines takedown notices</a> that academics have been receiving from publisher <strong>Elsevier</strong> for articles &ndash; articles they&rsquo;ve written &ndash; that they&rsquo;ve uploaded to the research-sharing site <strong>Academia.edu</strong>. (Some scholars are getting <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/confessions/2013/12/10/around-the-web-elsevier-vs-academia-edu-vs-researchers/">takedown notices</a> for posting their articles to their own blogs too.)</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Toronto</strong> and <strong>Western University</strong> will <a href="http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/public/pdadc/2013_to_2014/30.htm">not</a> renew their contracts with <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Copyright">Access Copyright</a></strong>, a controversial Canadian copyright agency.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Schekman</strong>, who won the <strong>Nobel</strong> prize in medicine this year, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/09/how-journals-nature-science-cell-damage-science">says</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/09/nobel-winner-boycott-science-journals">that</a> &ldquo;his lab would no longer send research papers to the top-tier journals, <strong>Nature</strong>, <strong>Cell</strong> and <strong>Science</strong>. Schekman said pressure to publish in &lsquo;luxury&rsquo; journals encouraged researchers to cut corners and pursue trendy fields of science instead of doing more important work. The problem was exacerbated, he said, by editors who were not active scientists but professionals who favoured studies that were likely to make a splash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>National Library of Norway</strong> plans to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/11/5199472/norway-is-digitizing-all-its-books-and-making-them-free-to-read-online">digitize</a> all the books in its collection and make them available to read and search online. (Copyrighted materials will be accessible to those with a Norwegian IP address.)</p>
<p>Whose works will <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2013/12/10/class-of-2014/">enter the <strong>public domain</strong> in 2014</a> (in those countries with a &ldquo;life plus 70 years&rdquo; copyright term)? Beatrix Potter, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Fats Waller, among others. (Whose work will enter the public domain in the US? No one&rsquo;s.)</p>
<h2>MOOCs</h2>
<p><strong>MOOCs</strong> haven&rsquo;t lived up to their hype, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/us/after-setbacks-online-courses-are-rethought.html">The New York Times is ON IT</a>.</p>
<p>An unintentionally hilarious headline from <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/georgia-tech-designs-its-udacity-pilot-to-avoid-failure/48947">The Chronicle</a> on the <strong>Udacity</strong> and <strong>Georgia Tech</strong> MOOC Master&rsquo;s Degree program: &ldquo;Georgia Tech Designs Its Udacity Pilot to Avoid Failure.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/13/georgia-tech-admits-first-cohort-ahead-online-masters-degree-program-launch">Inside Higher Ed</a> reviews the soon-to-launch program too, noting that the MOOC enrollees are overwhelmingly white, US men (that is, there is much less diversity online than there is in the on-campus version of the program).</p>
<p>Several interesting blog posts published by <strong>Open University</strong> professor Martin Weller this week on research (RESEARCH!!) he&rsquo;s conducting on MOOCs: <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/12/the-learning-design-of-moocs.html">on learning design</a>, <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/12/completion-data-for-moocs.html">on completion rates</a>, and <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/12/design-responses-to-mooc-completion-rates.html">on design responses to those completion rates</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/69518555384/this-holiday-season-learn-on-the-go-with-the-new">launched</a> an iPhone app. Because the year would have been incomplete without one.</p>
<h2>Other Online Courses</h2>
<p><strong>EverFi</strong> <a href="http://www.everfi.com/about/news/press-releases/everfi-hosts-higher-educations-largest-online-course">issued a press release</a> saying that it&rsquo;s hosted the largest online course, with 4 million students completing AlcoholEDU, its class on alcohol prevention.</p>
<h2>Brick and Mortar News</h2>
<p><strong>Cooper Union</strong>, whose trustees said this year that the university would start charging tuition for the first time in its history, <a href="http://studentactivism.net/2013/12/11/cooper-union-blinks/">might not do so after all</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>New York City</strong> is planning to open a new high school next year,&rdquo; <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304014504579250680794336834">reports The Wall Street Journal</a>, &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t have a gym, library, science lab or even a math classroom. The city wants to open a so-called school without walls, one where students would take courses that combine online and classroom learning, while giving them more time for internships. <strong>Microsoft</strong> will help coordinate internships and industry mentors for students, who could receive certificates showing they have mastered Microsoft Office programs.&rdquo; The innovation. It burns.</p>
<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a <strong>federal budget deal</strong>. Yay. That means the next round of sequester cuts will be &ldquo;<a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/143539/">softer</a>.&rdquo; Yay.</p>
<p>Parts of <strong>Washington</strong>&rsquo;s new voter-approved <strong>charter school law</strong> have been found unconstitutional, <a href="http://www.columbian.com/news/2013/dec/12/judge-charter-school-law-unconstitutional-state/">according to the AP</a>, but the decision will not stop the first charters in the state which are scheduled to open in the fall of 2014.</p>
<p>The state of <strong>Kansas</strong> is <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2013/12/consortium_watch_kansas_drops_.html">pulling out</a> of the <strong>Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium</strong>, one of the two consortia designing Common Core assessments. Kansas says it will use tests created by its state university instead.</p>
<p>The <strong>Department of Education</strong> <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-announces-all-legal-same-sex-marriages-will-be-recognized-f">says</a> that it will recognize <strong>same-sex marriages</strong> when students complete their financial aid forms (<strong>FAFSAs</strong>).</p>
<p>A federal advisory panel has recommended that the <strong>Department of Education </strong>extend for one year the <strong>Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges</strong>&rsquo; accrediting powers. The ACCJC has come under fire for its decision to revoke the accreditation of the <strong>City College of San Francisco</strong>. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/13/accreditation-issues-practical-and-philosophical-display-dc">More details in Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p>Politico&rsquo;s Stephanie Simon <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/education-teachers-unions-moment-of-truth-national-education-association-american-federation-of-teachers-100813.html#.UqRz7iIp4_0.twitter">examines</a> <strong>teachers unions</strong>&rsquo; &ldquo;moment of truth&rdquo; &ndash; declining membership, PR challenges, and struggles to retain their influence.</p>
<p><strong>Lorenzo Garcia</strong>, the former superintendent of the <strong>El Paso ISD</strong>, has had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/us/sentence-cut-in-texas-for-school-official-jailed-in-test-scandal.html">one year cut</a> from his sentence. He pleaded guilty last year in a <strong>cheating scandal</strong> that involved preventing low-performing students from taking assessments in order to boost the district&rsquo;s scores.</p>
<p>The <strong>Department of Education</strong> released the findings from analysis of its <strong>school improvement grant (SIG) program</strong> last month. But now that will have to be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/contractors-error-forces-education-dept-to-scrap-analysis-of-5-billion-school-program/2013/12/12/21acf1ec-636a-11e3-a373-0f9f2d1c2b61_story.html">scrapped</a>, as the contractor inadvertently excluded data from some schools.</p>
<p><strong>EPIC</strong> has <a href="https://epic.org/2013/12/epic-files-privacy-complaint-t.html">filed</a> a privacy complaint against <strong>Scholarships.com</strong>, which &ldquo;encourages students to divulge sensitive medical, sexual, and religious information to obtain financial aid information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The LAUSD iPad saga continues. &ldquo;<strong>Los Angeles</strong> school district officials have postponed plans to provide <strong>iPads</strong> to all teachers and administrators but still want to use the tablets for new standardized tests this spring,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-teacher-ipads-postponed-20131209,0,3422933.story#axzz2n5q4mgYc">reports The LA Times</a>.</p>
<h2>Upgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong> has updated the reward plan on its <strong>Kindle FreeTime</strong> subscription service. The &ldquo;<a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2013/amazon-kid-smarter-kindle-freetime-automated-educational-goals/">Learn First</a>&rdquo; will allow parents to force kids to spend a certain amount of time on &ldquo;educational content&rdquo; before moving on to other stuff. Recommendation engines for parenting. How lovely.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> announced <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2013/12/more-chromebook-options-for-your.html">new <strong>Dell Chromebooks</strong></a>. And here&rsquo;s a bigger win, I&rsquo;d argue, for Chromebooks&rsquo; PR: Philadelphia&rsquo;s <strong>Science Leadership Academy</strong> is <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2013/12/switch_from_mac_chromebook.html">switching</a> from MacBooks to Chromebooks. Apple has repeatedly used SLA in its education advertising so it looks like it really dropped the ball here by not helping support an amazing, award-winning, Apple-friendly school in a financially troubled district. (SLA&rsquo;s Chromebooks will be paid for, in part, by a grant from Dell.)</p>
<p>The Dutch startup <strong>Gibbon</strong> launched this week with &ldquo; curated learning playlists to help anyone teach themselves just about anything.&rdquo; &ldquo;A different kind of education startup,&rdquo; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/10/gibbon-learning-playlists/">says Techcrunch</a>. Different from what, it&rsquo;s not clear.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Shakespeare</strong>, an app that helps introduce 8&ndash;13 year olds to (obviously) Shakespeare, has <a href="http://startingshakespeare.deeperricher.com/">launched</a> with an iOS app and teacher handbook.</p>
<p>The <strong>Edmonton Public Library</strong> <a href="http://metronews.ca/news/edmonton/880829/new-edmonton-public-library-digital-space-boasts-3d-printers-book-printing-machine/">now has a Makerspace</a>.</p>
<p>The education video startup <strong>creativeLIVE</strong> will now broadcast 24&ndash;7 because, <a href="http://pando.com/2013/12/12/education-channel-creativelive-goes-24-7-because-apparently-theres-a-demand-for-that/">in the insightful words of PandoDaily</a>, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a demand for that.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Downgrades</h2>
<p>The <strong>Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood</strong> wants <strong>Fisher Price</strong> to <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/group-wants-fisher-price-ipad-bouncy-seat-recall">recall</a> an infant seat with an <strong>iPad</strong> holder, the &ldquo;Newborn-to-Toddler Apptivity Seat for iPads&rdquo; because holy crap, parents, hold and play with your babies.</p>
<p>But the award for the &ldquo;<a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/12/11/potty-with-built-in-tablet-hol.html">worst toy of 2013</a>&rdquo; goes to the <strong>CTA Digital 2-in&ndash;1 iPotty with Activity Seat for iPad</strong>.</p>
<h2>Funding and Acquisitions</h2>
<p><strong>Rosetta Stone</strong> has <a href="http://www.tellmemore.com/Press-Releases/Rosetta-Stone-to-Acquire-Leading-International-Lan.aspx">acquired</a> the language learning company <strong>Tell Me More</strong> for &euro;20.75 million ($28 million).</p>
<p><strong>NewSchools Venture Fund</strong> has released its list of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.newschools.org/blog/whos-funding-k-12-edtech">who&rsquo;s funding K&ndash;12 edtech</a>&rdquo; (a move that reminds me we need much better, open data about this. A project for me for 2014 perhaps).</p>
<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p><strong>Gordon Gee</strong>, most recently the president of Ohio State University (he stepped down this summer after controversial remarks about Notre Dame and Catholics), will take the helm of <strong>West Virginia University</strong> &ndash; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/09/gordon-gee-star-college-president-back">at least on an interim basis</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-12-10-former-echalks-moodlerooms-execs-join-unbound-concepts">Edsurge reports</a> that <strong>Martin Brutosky</strong>, former CEO of eChalks, and <strong>Tom Murdock</strong>, co-founder of Moodlerooms, have joined <strong>UnBound Concepts</strong>, a startup that&rsquo;s building an &ldquo;adaptive book recommendation engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>New York Times</strong> media columnist <strong>David Carr</strong> will <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/10/new-york-times-columnist-david-carr-join-boston-university-faculty/1cn88xodrK607DWlj4gR3I/story.html">join</a> <strong>Boston University</strong> &ldquo;to fill a new endowed chair dedicated to exploring creative business models to support journalism in the digital era.&rdquo; (He&rsquo;ll keep his day job at The NYT.)</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>DreamBox Learning</strong> was found to have no discernible effects on mathematics achievement for elementary school students,&rdquo; is the conclusion of a <a href="http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=627">report</a> issued by the Institute of Education Sciences.</p>
<p><strong>Fordham University</strong> has released a study on &ldquo;<a href="http://law.fordham.edu/center-on-law-and-information-policy/30198.htm"><strong>Privacy</strong> and Cloud Computing in Public Schools</a>.&rdquo; Among the findings: &ldquo;Districts surrender control of student information when using cloud services: fewer than 25% of the agreements specify the purpose for disclosures of student information, fewer than 7% of the contracts restrict the sale or marketing of student information by vendors, and many agreements allow vendors to change the terms without notice.&rdquo; The study, it&rsquo;s probably worth noting, was sponsored by <strong>Microsoft</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>National Student Clearinghouse Research Center</strong> has published its latest <a href="http://nscresearchcenter.org/currenttermenrollmentestimate-fall2013/">report</a> on current term <strong>college enrollment</strong>. &ldquo;In fall 2013, overall postsecondary enrollments decreased 1.5% from the previous fall. In fall 2013, enrollments decreased among four-year for-profit institutions (&ndash;9.7 percent) and two-year public institutions (&ndash;3.1 percent). However, enrollments increased slightly among four-year public institutions (+0.3%) and four-year private non-profit institutions (+1.3%).&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>MIT</strong> neuroscientists have <a href="http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/even-when-test-scores-go-up-some-cognitive-abilities-dont-1211.html">found</a> that &ldquo;schools whose students have the highest gains on test scores do not produce similar gains in &lsquo;fluid intelligence&rsquo; &mdash; the ability to analyze abstract problems and think logically.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Center for the Study of Race and Equity has issued a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/12/how-colleges-fail-black-football-players/282258/">report</a> on the <strong>graduation rates of black men</strong> on football teams participating in the 2014 Bowl Championship Series.

<h2>School &ldquo;Safety&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of the shootings at an elementary school in <strong>Newtown</strong>. There was <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_24718883/reports-shots-fired-at-arapahoe-high-school">another shooting at a Colorado high school today</a>.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve sifted through all the education news from 2013 in order to write my year-end review posts, I&rsquo;m struck by how much violence we&rsquo;ve seen in schools this year and how it&rsquo;s increasingly normalized. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/12/the-school-shootings-you-didn-t-hear-about-one-every-two-weeks-since-newtown.html">One school shooting every two weeks since Newtown</a>. Shooters and suspected shooters and lockdowns across K&ndash;12 and university campuses. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/26/news/companies/school-shootings-bulletproof-whiteboards/">Bulletproof whiteboards</a>, for crying out loud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AlterNet examines the <strong><a href="http://www.alternet.org/militarization-america-campus-cops-get-armored-vehicle-built-withstand-ieds-and-mines">militarization of college campuses</a></strong>. Here&rsquo;s a gem from the article: &ldquo;the campus cops at <strong>Ohio State University</strong> now possess a MRAP; that is, a $500,000 18-ton, mine-resistant, ambush-protected armored vehicle of a sort used in the Afghan War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>WTF is wrong with us?!</p>
