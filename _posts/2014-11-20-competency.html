<h2>What is Competency-Based Education?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Competency-based  education&rdquo; (CBE) is being hailed by some as a way to rethink education &mdash;  to save money and to boost "outcomes." Often, competency-based  education is framed as a way to save (students&rsquo;) time.</p>
<p>Rather than  moving students together through materials for a fixed duration of a  class, CBE enables students to move at their own pace through the  curriculum. They are assessed along the way, and if they can demonstrate  &ldquo;competency&rdquo; on a particular skill, they can move forward to the next.  This is seen as an alternative to traditional models where students  receive a grade &mdash; and credit &mdash; at the end of the course, but that grade  can range from A to D, meaning that students have attained very  different levels of understanding of the course materials.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not entirely a new idea. <a href="http://www.ajol.info/index.php/jfecs/article/viewFile/52788/41390">According to SPT Malin</a>,  the concept was introduced in the United States in the 1960s "in  reaction to concerns that students are not taught the skills they  require in life after school.&rdquo; Malin points to 6 &ldquo;critical components&rdquo;  in CBE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explicit learning outcomes with respect to the required skills and concomitant proficiency (standards for assessment)</li>
<li>A flexible time frame to master these skills</li>
<li>A variety of instructional activities to facilitate learning</li>
<li>Criterion-referenced testing of the required outcomes</li>
<li>Certification based on demonstrated learning outcomes</li>
<li>Adaptable programmes to ensure optimum learner guidance</li>
</ul>
<p>CBE  is sometimes referred to  as&nbsp;proficiency-based,&nbsp;mastery-based,&nbsp;outcome-based,&nbsp;performance-based,  and&nbsp;standards-based&nbsp;education. Those adjectives are used to in  conjunction with &ldquo;instruction" and &ldquo;learning" as well (that is,  mastery-based learning, competency-based instruction). And to complicate  things, one US Department of Education <a href="http://www.ed.gov/oii-news/competency-based-learning-or-personalized-learning">description</a> combines competency-based learning and personalized-learning together (Here is an EML look at &ldquo;<a href="http://modernlearners.com/the-problem-with-personalization/">personalization</a>&rdquo;). From the DoE:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>By  enabling students to master skills at their own pace, competency-based  learning systems help to save both time and money. Depending on the  strategy pursued, competency-based systems also create multiple pathways  to graduation, make better use of technology, support new staffing  patterns that utilize teacher skills and interests differently, take  advantage of learning opportunities outside of school hours and walls,  and help identify opportunities to target interventions to meet the  specific learning needs of students. Each of these presents an  opportunity to achieve greater efficiency and increase productivity.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So  while it seems like there&rsquo;s a fairly straightforward definition, CBE is  actually used in different ways &mdash; in online and offline scenarios, by  higher education and by K-12 &mdash; to describe some very different  practices.</p>
<p>What do we mean by &ldquo;competency,&rdquo; for example? Who decides what counts? What does this look like in practice?</p>
<p><em>Answer</em>: it varies.</p>
<p>There  is no single model for competency-based education. There is no  agreed-upon standard for what constitutes &ldquo;competency&rdquo; or &ldquo;proficiency.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Who Is Doing It?</h2>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bigpicture.org/2012/11/new-report-highlights-big-picture-learning%E2%80%99s-successful-model-of-competency-education/">Big Picture Learning School </a><br /> <a href="http://www.wgu.edu/">Western Governors University</a><br /> <a href="http://flex.wisconsin.edu/competency-based-education-what-it-is-how-its-different-and-why-it-matters-to-you/">University of Wisconsin</a><br /> <a href="http://www.sbsadams50.org/content/">Adams County School District 50 </a><br /> <a href="http://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/assets/pdf/A5171001225.PDF">The state of Michigan</a><br /> <a href="http://www.chugachschools.com/index.html">Chugach School District</a><br /> <a href="http://www.cael.org/pdfs/2012_CompetencyBasedProgramshttp://">Council for Adult and Experiential Learning</a></p>
<p>These  help highlight how different states and schools define and approach CBE  (and, in turn, how different the implementations can be).</p>
<h2>What Technologies Are Used?</h2>
<p>Arguably,  some of the push for CBE comes from a move towards more computer-based  education. The argument is that technologies enable different sorts of  tracking and assessment (more granular, for example) and provide  opportunities for more self-pacing.</p>
<p>Specific technologies used to  support CBE include &ldquo;data dashboards" that display progress to students  (and to teachers), standards-based grade books, portfolios, and <a href="http://www.openbadges.org/">badges</a>&nbsp; (and other &ldquo;micro credentials&rdquo;). Tools that support CBE, <a href="http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI7110.pdf">Educause argues</a>, "enable widespread changes that could result in a rethinking of pedagogy, assessment, and the concept of the credit hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>But  what exactly do those changes look like? Are they learner-centered? Do  they allow more inquiry-based learning? Or do they simply change the  timing and testing of </em>instruction<em>?</em></p>
<h2>Questions To Consider</h2>
<p>How might CBE's emphasis on "skills" change what and how things are taught? Do &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; concepts tend to be lost, for example?</p>
<p>How  might CBE's emphasis on the "modularity" of skills shape teaching and  learning? What does it mean to see knowledge as "modular" in this way?  Does this mean that knowledge is seen as static? As decontextualized? Or  only contextualized through a certain "order" of skills?</p>
<p>To  repeat an earlier question, what is "competency"? Who decides? How is it  different from current assessment decisions? (Is it?)</p>
<p>Can students be engaged in determining "competencies"? How might CBE help give students more responsibility?</p>
<p>While  CBE promises to change things like &ldquo;seat time,&rdquo; does it necessarily  change other traditional outcomes of school? Is it still focused, for  example, on the things that are &ldquo;measurable&rdquo;?</p>
<p>What support systems  &mdash; people and technology &mdash; need to be in place for schools to  successfully move to CBE? What other frameworks need to be in place to  promote a "progressive" CBE?</p>
<p>What policies might need to change  for CBE to be more readily adopted? And always key to ask: who are the  biggest advocates of these policy changes? Why?</p>
