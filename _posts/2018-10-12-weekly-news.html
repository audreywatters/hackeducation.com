<p><em>Each week, I gather a wide variety of links to education and education technology articles. All this work feeds the review I write each December on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the stories we are told</a> about the future of education.</em></p>

<h3>(National) Education Politics <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2018_icon_politics2.jpg" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>Perhaps the disappearance (and reported murder) of <strong>Washington Post</strong> contributor <strong>Jamal Khashoggi</strong> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/10/10/trumps-nasty-apathy-about-jamal-khashoggi/">doesn&#8217;t seem</a> like an education technology story. But it matters. In part, I am including it here at the top of my weekly news roundup because, as a journalist, I find the political climate right now to be incredibly frightening for people in my profession. </p>

<p>But it is also, I&#8217;d argue, a story that is deeply connected to many of the people that I write about regularly. And that&#8217;s because, Silicon Valley has courted Saudi wealth. &#8220;<strong>Silicon Valley&#8217;s Saudi Arabia Problem</strong>,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/opinion/silicon-valley-saudi-arabia.html">as Anand Giridharadas puts it in The New York Times</a>. &#8220;Technology companies can no longer turn a blind eye to the human rights abuses of one of their largest investors.&#8221; <strong>SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund</strong> is funded in part by Saudi billions. <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/5/16974032/this-is-where-chart-softbank-vision-fund-masayoshi-son-venture-capital">Among the fund&#8217;s ed-tech investments</a>: <strong>WeWork</strong>, <strong>SoFi</strong>, and perhaps soon <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-01/softbank-is-said-to-seek-investment-in-chinese-education-startup"><strong>Zuoyebang</strong></a>. When the <strong>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman</strong> toured the US recently, he hung out with <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong>, <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>, and <strong>Sergey Brin</strong>, for example. Among those involved in bin Salman&#8217;s $500 billion megacity project, Neom, venture capitalist <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong> and former <strong>Uber</strong> CEO <strong>Travis Kalanick</strong>.</p>

<p>Speaking of billionaires shaping the future, &#8220;<strong>Betsy DeVos</strong> was in Wichita,&#8221; <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/local/education/article219557930.html">says The Wichita Eagle</a>, &#8220;but not many people knew about it.&#8221; She was, apparently, at <strong>Koch Industries</strong>. </p>

<p>&#8220;The <strong>U.S. Department of Education</strong> at a convening here yesterday awarded recognition to 10 educational technology projects aiming to expand access to education and pipelines to the work force,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/10/12/education-department-honors-tech-initiatives">Inside Higher Ed reports</a>. <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-10-11-in-announcing-winners-of-higher-ed-challenge-ed-dept-looks-ahead-to-2030">Edsurge was there too</a>. And there&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/@OfficeofEdTech/announcing-the-winners-of-the-reimagining-higher-education-ecosystem-challenge-6d6d93e22140">a blog post on Medium</a>, because I guess someone thinks it&#8217;s a good idea for the <strong>Office of Ed Tech</strong> to outsource its website to a for-profit company. (You can sorta see this attitude &#8211; the future is for-profit &#8211; in the winners of its grant challenge too.)</p>
