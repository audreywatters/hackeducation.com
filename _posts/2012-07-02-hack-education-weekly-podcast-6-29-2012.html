<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down to talk about the latest ed-tech news and the posts I've written here on Hack Education. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>It's only been a week since Steve and I saw each other, but with ISTE12 and Google IO occuring in the intervening days, we had a lot to talk about. So fair warning, this episode runs a little over our normal 60 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>0:39</strong>: &nbsp;Our impressions of ISTE12 -- exhibitors, attendees, the necessity (or not) of conferences, and the future of ISTE as an organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>38:18:</strong> &nbsp;The lack of data portability in (ed-)tech.</p>
<p><strong>46:00</strong>: &nbsp;Android-user Steve gives Apple-user me a hard time for attending Google IO (and coming home with 4 new Google gadgets). &nbsp;That aside, what are Google's plans for education?</p>
