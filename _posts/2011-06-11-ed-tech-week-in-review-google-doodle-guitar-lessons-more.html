<p>Apple released an update to its e-books app, <strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8">iBooks</a></strong>.  Among the new features is a built-in "read aloud" option for select children's books.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/consumer/kids-today-how-the-class-of-2011-engages-with-media/">Nielsen</a> released a report on how the Class of 2011 engages with media, finding that -- no surprise -- teens out-<strong>text-message</strong> any other age group, more than doubling the rate of the next highest age group.  (That's an average of 3364 texts per month for 13-17 year olds and about 1640 for 18-24 year olds.)  Although teens are the heaviest users of mobile video, they watch less television than any other age group.</p>

I have lost score in the ongoing battle between Microsoft and Google for this market, but if someone is still tracking on how the companies are divvying up the states, here's one for the Microsoft column.</p>
<p>As MindShift <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/06/wireless-generation-awarded-27-million-contract-by-ny-schools/">reported yesterday</a>, the education-technology company <strong><a href="http://www.wirelessgeneration.com/">Wireless Generation</a></strong> has been awarded a $27 million no-bid contract with the <strong>New York City Public Schools</strong>.
