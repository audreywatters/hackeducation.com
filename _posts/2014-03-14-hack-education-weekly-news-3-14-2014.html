<p><em>Happy Pi Day! And&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-tim-berners-lee-on-25th-anniversary-of-world-wide-web-a-958304.html"><em>happy 25th anniversary to the World Wide Web</em></a>!</p>
<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p>The defense has begun to make its case in <strong><em>Vergara vs. California</em></strong>, a lawsuit brought by <strong>StudentsMatter</strong> that charges that&nbsp;<strong>tenure</strong> and seniority rules prevent students from having effective teachers and as a result from getting a quality education. StudentsMatter is a non-profit created by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-callahan/meet-the-tech-entrepreneu_b_4718858.html">tech entrepreneur David Welch</a>. Welch is also an investor in <strong>NewSchools Venture Fund</strong>. NewSchools Venture Fund is in turn an investor in <strong>Rocketship Education</strong>. One of the plaintiffs in this case is the <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/2014/03/teacher-tenure-case-now-turns-defense">daughter of a Rocketship employee</a>. Wow. Small world, huh.</p>
<p>The Senate has <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-arne-duncan-james-h-shelton-iii-being-confirmed">confirmed</a> <strong>Jim Shelton</strong> as <strong>Deputy Secretary of Education</strong>. <strong>Ted Mitchell</strong>, the CEO of <strong>NewSchools Venture Fund</strong>, still awaits confirmation as Under Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>Netflix</strong> CEO, former owner of <strong>DreamBox Learning</strong>, and ed reform funder <strong>Reed Hastings</strong> spoke at the <strong>California Charter Schools Association</strong> last week, where he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/03/14/netflixs-reed-hastings-has-a-big-idea-kill-elected-school-boards/">expressed his dismay</a> that public schools have elected <strong>school boards</strong>, something he contends makes them unstable and the schools in turn inferior to charter schools. In other words, what&rsquo;s wrong with public schools? <strong>Democracy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Learning Now</strong>, an initiative of <strong>Excellence in Education</strong>, has issued its <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/03/13/states-show-improvement-on-digital-learning-report-card.aspx">latest report cards</a> on how states have conformed to its ed-tech policy advice. Two states got an A: <strong>Utah</strong> and <strong>Florida</strong>. Did I mention that Excellence in Education is former Florida governor<strong> Jeb Bush</strong>&rsquo;s organization? Yeah. Good thing all these ed reform folks are such straight shooters, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/texas-school-districts-balk-at-state-requirement-f/nd9Ty/?icmp=statesman_internallink_invitationbox_apr2013_statesmanstubtomystatesman_launch">new law</a> in <strong>Texas</strong> that requires (~$100) graphing calculators for eighth-grade standardized tests. (Gee, I wonder which company lobbied for <em>that</em> rule?) According to the Austin American-Statesman, school officials would like to use a cheaper mobile app (~$15) instead. Good grief. Use <strong>Desmos</strong>. It's free. It works on that wonderful thing, the World Wide Web, and doesn&rsquo;t require you buy everyone an iPad (which last time I checked is still more expensive than a graphing calculator).</p>
<p>The <strong>GAO</strong> says that the <strong>Department of Education</strong> has <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/03/13/gao-cites-serious-weaknesses-federal-oversight-debt-management-system">failed</a> to provide proper oversight to the program that&rsquo;s supposed to help <strong>defaulted student loan borrowers</strong> get their loans (and their credit) back on track.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tennessee</strong> House has <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20140313/NEWS02/303130101?sf23828422=1&amp;nclick_check=1">voted</a> to delay the state&rsquo;s implementation of the <strong>Common Core</strong>.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure that it&rsquo;ll handle the issues surrounding their abominable environmental practices really fairly.</p>

<p>A panel appointed by <strong>New York</strong> governor Andrew Cuomo has <a href="http://www.wgrz.com/story/news/education/2014/03/10/cuomo-common-core-pannel-inbloom/6273513/">recommended</a> that the state sever ties with data infrastructure company <strong>inBloom</strong>.</p>
<p>In other data management news, officials in <strong>North Carolina</strong> want some <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/02/28/4731119/nc-on-troubled-school-data-system.html#.UyNBmFFdWRw">money back</a> from <strong>Pearson</strong> because of ongoing issues with the state&rsquo;s implementation of PowerSchool. It&rsquo;s paying $7.1 million a year to the company, says the Charlotte Observer.</p>
<p>The <strong>Supreme Court</strong> has <a href="http://legalclips.nsba.org/2014/03/14/supreme-court-declines-to-review-i-%E2%99%A5-boobies-bracelet-decision/">refused</a> Easton Area School District&rsquo;s request to review a lower court decision that had struck down the district&rsquo;s ban on students wearing I &hearts; boobies breast cancer awareness bracelets.</p>
<p>The faculty at <strong>Portland State University</strong> have <a href="http://www.statesmanjournal.com/article/20140313/UPDATE/140313004">voted</a> to authorize a strike.</p>

<p><a href="http://terrya.edublogs.org/2014/03/13/does-teaching-presence-matter-in-a-mooc/">A study on MOOCs</a> that asked &ldquo;<strong>do professors matter</strong>?&rdquo; has concluded that &ldquo;teacher presence had no significant relation to course completion, most badges awarded, intent to register in subsequent MOOCs or course satisfaction.&rdquo; But don&rsquo;t worry, <em>no one</em> wants to replace teachers with technology.</p>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> reports on the <strong>gender</strong> breakdown in its user base. <strong>Romania</strong> fields the highest representation of female Coursera students, with women comprising almost half of its enrollments. Just 26% of Coursera students from <strong>India</strong> are female. More <a href="http://tech.coursera.org/blog/2014/03/08/what-about-the-women/">via the company&rsquo;s tech blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Other Educational TV</h2>
<p>The rebooted <em><strong>Cosmos</strong></em> premiered last weekend on FOX, with <strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson</strong> in the role of host. I watched (and wasn&rsquo;t terribly impressed, although I admit, I was a huge fan of the PBS, ad-free <strong>Carl Sagan</strong> version). But far <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-neil-degrasse-tysons-cosmos-premiere-ratings-notsostellar-on-fox-20140310,0,5705372.story#axzz2vc8h8bUj">more Americans tuned in to watch Resurrection</a>, a show about people who come back from the dead. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/why-em-cosmos-em-can-t-save-public-support-for-science/284355/">Because science</a>.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p><a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/study-women-who-can-do-math-still-dont-get-hired/">A study</a> has found that managers looking for someone with <strong>math skills</strong> are twice as likely to hire a man over a woman, even when women are equally skilled.

But despite its endorsement by Beyonce, the campaign reeks of <a href="http://theweek.com//article/index/257855/the-white-privilege-behind-sheryl-sandbergs-ban-bossy-campaign">white privilege</a>, as the adjective &ldquo;bossy&rdquo; is a lot more complicated for women of color, particularly Black women. Let&rsquo;s remember Shirley Chisholm, for example, who unlike Sandberg, was &ldquo;Unbought and Unbossed.&rdquo;</p>
