<p><a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/12/09/the-year-in-ed-tech-part-4-social-learning-social-networks/">Social learning</a> network <a href="http://www.edmodo.com">Edmodo</a> announced today that it has added a new feature:  <a href="http://blog.edmodo.com/2011/01/10/parent-accounts-now-available/">parent accounts</a>.</p>
<p>With parent accounts, teachers will be able to communicate easily with parents, giving them access to grades, assignments, sending them notifications about upcoming due dates and missed assignments, and alerting them to school events and activities.</p>
<p>As a parent, I absolutely love this new feature.  Even with the advent of email, I've long felt a gulf between what happens at school and what I know about what happens at school.  Edmodo's parent accounts make it much easier to maintain open communication channels between the classroom and home.</p>
