<p>There&rsquo;s been plenty of buzz lately about the ways in which online video is poised &ldquo;disrupt&rdquo; education &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s via the growing video library of <a href="http://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> or through the video-based lectures and lessons offered by the flurry of new MOOCs (namely those offered by <a href="http://coursera.com">Coursera</a>, <a href="http://udacity.com">Udacity</a>, and <a href="http://edx.org">edX</a>).</p>
<p>But the news out of <a href="http://mit.edu">MIT</a> today &ndash; one of the founding members of the edX initiative &ndash; offers a very different sort of video education. And these videos make a very different argument too from the MOOCs and the Khan Academies of the world; it&rsquo;s an argument that highlights several things that the hype about video-based instruction seems to ignore.</p>
<p>1) The value of a campus-based university experience<br />2) The importance of hands-on learning, particularly when it comes to STEM education.</p>
<p>MIT is unveiling the trailer today for a new reality TV series (of sorts) &ndash; <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/bootcamp/">ChemLab Boot Camp</a> &ndash; that follows 14 freshmen through its 5.301 Introductory Lab Techniques course. The four-week-long class is offered in January as part of the Chemistry major. The stakes with 5.301 are high &ndash; students who pass the class are guaranteed a job in a research lab at the university.</p>
<p>As such, the new show could be seen as an infomercial for the MIT campus experience. And as the project was underwritten by the Dow Chemical Company, it&rsquo;s certainly good promotional material for that company and, more generally, the MIT chemistry major. But the reality TV show is also a commercial of sorts for hands-on learning and for the joys and frustrations of working in a research lab.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an important message for prospective scientists to hear &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re in high school or college. Indeed, late last year, The New York Times examined some of the reasons why we&rsquo;re seeing so few students graduate with degrees in STEM fields. While part of the argument was &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/why-science-majors-change-their-mind-its-just-so-darn-hard.html">it&rsquo;s just so darn hard</a>,&rdquo; the article also highlighted the emphasis on lectures and dearth of opportunities for hands-on experimentation. (I wrote a follow-up post <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/retaining-stem-dropouts">here</a>.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that this video series comes out of the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu">MIT OpenCourseWare</a> office and is connected to that program&rsquo;s larger outreach efforts with high school students. Its <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/highschool">Highlights for High School</a> initiative organizes over 70 introductory level courses from the university&rsquo;s OCW site as well as other resources, to help high school students prepare for the AP exam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope to show the human side of our field and to inspire young people to want to become the next generation of chemists,&rdquo; says MIT Professor John Essigmann. And inspiration and humanness &ndash; particularly when depicted through the experiences of freshman students &ndash; are pretty compelling here. &ldquo;Do you make mistakes?&rdquo; asks one freshman in frustration as her experiment on Day 3 or so goes awry. And the video then offers anecdotes about failures from the course&rsquo;s TAs, from other students who&rsquo;ve successfully completed 5.301 and now work in labs around campus, and from professors themselves. &ldquo;Of course you have failures,&rdquo; says one. &ldquo;But then you have to move on.&rdquo; And the narrative of this particular episode confirms this, as the freshman says at the end, &ldquo;This is so encouraging. If she can learn, then I can learn. And some day I&rsquo;ll be just as good as she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The show officially starts September, but watch the video below for a sneak peak.</p>
