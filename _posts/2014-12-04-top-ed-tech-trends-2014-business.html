<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 2 of my <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com">Top 10 Trends of 2014</a> series</em></p>

<p>I usually <em>end</em> my analysis of all the trends in ed-tech on the topic of &ldquo;the business of ed-tech.&rdquo; (See: <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/12/23/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-business">2013</a>, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/11/19/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-the-business-of-ed-tech">2012</a>, <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/16/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2011-the-business-of-ed-tech">2011</a>.) Because &ldquo;the business of ed-tech&rdquo; really (sadly) sums up so handily most of what has happened in education technology over the course of the past few years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The business of ed-tech&rdquo; is also the &ldquo;politics of ed-tech.&rdquo; The business and the politics of ed-tech together dictate almost all the other trends that I&rsquo;ll cover in this year-end series. MOOCs. Big data. Learning analytics. Privacy. Competency-based education. Buzzwords.</p>
<p>One way to identify the dominant ed-tech trends is to look at what venture capitalists are <em>funding</em>. Another is to look at what government policies are <em>demanding</em>. The state of Maryland, for example, <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-01-16/news/bs-md-technology-schools-20140116_1_tests-technology-upgrades-districts">said</a> this year that it would need to invest $100 million in technology upgrades in order to be ready for the new online testing mandated by the Common Core State Standards.</p>
<p>New hardware. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_26666181/san-jose-states-costly-high-tech-upgrade-cisco">New infrastructure</a>. <a href="http://www.schooldata.com/product_releases/mdr_StateK12MarketReport13.htm">New curriculum</a>. <a href="http://b.3cdn.net/dpromise/4e2869abb217c9062f_z6m6v2v9u.pdf">New expenditures</a>.</p>
<p>So&hellip; who benefits?</p>
