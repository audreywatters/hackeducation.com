<h3>Education Law and Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>The <strong>US House of Representatives</strong> (barely) passed a $1.1 trillion spending bill this week. While education spending will remain <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/150765/">mostly flat</a>, there are a number of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/10/congress-cuts-federal-financial-aid-for-needy-students/">cuts</a> to education programs, including $303 million to the <strong>Pell Grant</strong> program. (However, Pell Grants will <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/12/09/obama-administration-says-juvenile-offenders-may-receive-pell-grants">now be available</a> to those incarcerated in <strong>juvenile detention centers</strong>.)</p>
<p>The Obama Administration <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8545ca21c9b34d6fb89cc8f4c069e59b/obama-announcing-1b-early-childhood-education">announced</a> $1 billion in &ldquo;public-private spending&rdquo; for <strong>early childhood education</strong>, in an attempt to boost the number of children with access to high quality preschool. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/12/10/education-secretary-hosts-twitter-chat-with-shakira/">held a Twitter chat</a> with singer <strong>Shakira</strong> to mark the occasion.</p>

<p>The <strong>FCC</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/business/fcc-lifts-financing-for-internet-programs.html">approved</a> an overhaul to the <strong>E-rate program</strong> (which subsidizes high-speed Internet for public schools and libraries). This includes a $1.5 billion boost in funding to the program.</p>

Meanwhile, the district might not be ready for assessments due to a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_27096524/lausd-students-might-not-be-ready-new-tests?source=infinite">lag</a>&rdquo; in distributing new devices. And the district <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/morning-read-lausd-needs-11-illion-more-to-fix-misis/">says</a> it needs $11 million more to fix its broken <strong>student information system</strong>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Education companies that sell more than $150,000 in goods or services to a school district will be required to <strong>negotiate</strong> the profit on any contracts using federal funds, under new rules that become effective Dec. 26,&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/12/education_companies_profits_on_federal_contracts_to_be_negotiated.html">reports Education Week</a>.</p>

<p>The Wake County (North Carolina) school district could ban <strong>selfies</strong> &ndash; <a href="http://www.eschoolnews.com/2014/12/08/school-bans-selfies-723/">that&rsquo;s the headline</a>. The proposed policy would require teacher permission before students take photos at school.</p>

<h3>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h3>
<br />
<p><strong>MIT</strong> <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/lewin-courses-removed-1208">announced</a> this week that it was removing the online courses of <strong>Walter Lewin</strong>, an emeritus professor of physics, after discovering that he had engaged in the <strong>online sexual harassment</strong> of a female student. Lewin has been an incredibly popular professor, and the YouTube videos of demonstrations from his physics courses at MIT have had millions of views. Prior to the rise of Salman Khan and Khan Academy, Lewin was the YouTube education star. All those videos are now gone as MIT has tried to scrub Lewin&rsquo;s presence from the Web. According to the university, &ldquo;MIT&rsquo;s action comes in response to a complaint it received in October from a woman, who is an online MITx learner, claiming online sexual harassment by Lewin. She provided information about Lewin&rsquo;s interactions with her, which began when she was a learner in one of his MITx courses, as well as information about interactions between Lewin and other women online learners.&rdquo; More via <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/12/09/mit-removes-online-courses-professor-found-have-engaged-online-sexual-harassment">Inside Higher Ed</a> and <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/sexual-harassment-in-the-age-of-moocs/55229">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>.</p>
