<p>My big news of the week:  <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2011/07/28/read-written-resigned/">I'm leaving ReadWriteWeb</a>.  You'll still be able to find my writing here at Hack Education, at <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org">MindShift</a>, and at <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com">O'Reilly Radar</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://nsf.gov"><strong>National Science Foundation</strong></a> announced this week that it was kicking off a new program called <a href="http://www.innovationcorps.org/">Innovation Corps</a>, that would help transform promising academic research projects into viable startups.  Starting this fall, the NSF will provide 100 science and engineering projects with $50,000 in funding and will enroll them in a crash course on entrepreneurship, taught by Stanford's <a href="http://steveblank.com/2011/07/28/eureka-a-new-era-for-scientists-and-engineers/">Steve Blank</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://kno.com"><strong>Kno</strong></a> released the results of a study this week in which it found -- no surprise -- that college students are unhappy with high cost and cumbersome weight of textbooks.  The attention-grabbing stat may be that 25% said that they'd be willing to give up sex or dating to never have to carry textbooks again.  More troubling, 45% said they've had to cut back on buying food in order to afford their textbooks.  Although students are clearly not happy with textbooks, other studies have found that digital textbooks aren't quite ready for students yet, due to their own problems with cost, availability, and note-taking.</p>
<p><a href="http://akademos.com"><strong>Akademos</strong></a> announced that it will launch a new educational textbook app, and its first partner will be the OER textbook provider <a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/"><strong>Flat World Knowledge</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2011/07/30/student-teacher-facebook/">Mashable</a> reports that when Senate Bill 54 goes into effect in Missouri on August 28, it will ban all direct contact between teachers and students on social networking sites.  The bill is called the "Student Protection Act" and aimed at preventing sexual abuse.  It says that "<em>Teachers cannot establish, maintain, or use a work-related website unless it is available to school administrators and the child's legal custodian, physical custodian, or legal guardian. Teachers also cannot have a nonwork-related website that allows exclusive access with a current or former student.</em>"</p>
<p>The research collaboration platform <a href="http://mendeley.com"><strong>Mendeley</strong></a> left beta this week with the official release of Mendeley v1.0.  Mendeley allows you to gather and organize your research notes and build bibliographies, as well as interact with other researchers and academics.</p>
<p><strong>Evernote Peek</strong>, a nifty app that turns your iPad cover into a flashcard study system, had its first <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2011/07/26/evernote-peek-gets-audio-clues-linked-notebooks-and-more/">update</a> this week.  It now supports audio clues (and to help showcase the new functionality, Evernote has created a couple of new notebook with French and Spanish phrases and bird calls).  The app now also lets you share your notebooks, great for group study sessions.</p>
<p><a href="http://khanacademy.org"><strong>Khan Academy</strong></a> has launched a new exercise system, offering more exercises for students to practice the concepts they're learning via the site.  Khan Academy's John Resig outlines some of the development on the back-end that went into re-engineering the <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/khan-exercise-rewrite/">exercise framework</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://donorschoose.org"><strong>DonorsChoose.org</strong></a> has announced the grand prize winner of its recent <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/hacking-education-winners">Hacking Education</a> contest:  Michael Nutt, who developed a dynamic email signature that updated with DonorsChoose.org classroom projects.</p>
<p>Group-buying site <a href="http://groupon.com"><strong>Groupon</strong></a> offered a special deal this week to the residents of its hometown Chicago where a $12 deal went towards buying low-income students in the city back-to-school supplies, including glue, erasers, markers, pencils, notebooks and the like.  According to the <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-07-25/business/ct-met-cps-groupon-20110722_1_cps-students-school-supply-donations-groupon">Chicago Tribune</a>, about 85% of the district's 409,000 students come from low-income families.</p>
<p>The online flashcard service <a href="http://quizlet.com/"><strong>Quizlet</strong></a> has added a few new features, including offering its text-to-speech in eighteen languages.  It's also created a new study mode named "Speller" that plays an audio clip of a word that you then have to type correctly.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geobee/world-championship/"><strong>National Geographic World Championship</strong></a> was held at Google headquarters in Mountain View this week, with students from 17 regions around the world participating.  Congratulations to the team from <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2011/07/congratulations-russia-national.html">Russia</a>, the new world champions.</p>
<p>29 universities across the country have joined forces with a project to help extend their own high-speed networks to their surrounding communities.  Universities, particularly major research universities, often have Internet connections that are several hundred times faster than the typical residential connections, and <a href="http://www.gig-u.org/"><strong>Gig.U</strong></a> hopes to help spread high-speed networks off campus.</p>
