<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. Well, almost every week. We skipped a week, which means that the podcast we recorded on Saturday runs a little long. In fact, it runs a lot long. We cover two weeks' worth of education technology news, as well as two of my <a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=ed-tech%20trends%202012">year-end trends</a> posts.</p>
<p>But if you manage to listen all the way through this episode, I think you'll find that this is a good one. I know I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week. I hope you enjoy it too.</p>
