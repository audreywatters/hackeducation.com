<p>Every week,&nbsp;<a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a>&nbsp;and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week. You can listen to last week's episode (in which we discuss our thoughts on the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/01/18/the-internets-reactions-to-students-reactions-to-wikipedias-blackout/">anti-SOPA protests</a>, the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/01/17/the-public-library-as-arts-incubator/">library as incubator</a>, and of course the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/01/19/apple-and-the-textbook-counter-revolution/">Apple textbook announcement</a>) below. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I must admit, this is the best podcast we've recorded yet as I think the events of the week make clear that the stakes are incredibly high in education/technology right now, and Steve and I were fired up for this episode.</p>
