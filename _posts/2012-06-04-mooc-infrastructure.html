<p>Much of the mainstream media attention paid to MOOCs lately has involved the content, the credentialing, the cost, the class size. But what about the technology?</p>
<p>It was (not surprisingly)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.downes.ca/">Stephen Downes&rsquo; OLDaily</a>&nbsp;that got me thinking about what can we glean about MOOCs based on their infrastructure. Last week, Downes&rsquo; OLDaily highlighted a&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2012/05/31/learning-lernanta-the-code-that-runs-p2pu/">post</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href="https://p2pu.org/en/dirkcuys/">Dirk Uys</a>, a member of the P2PU tech team, that describes the code that runs Peer 2 Peer University. For his part, Downes noted the differences between that code, Lernanta (<a href="https://github.com/p2pu/lernanta">source code</a>), and his own gRSShopper (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/grsshopper/">source code</a>).</p>
<p>Django-based Lernanta is a fork of the code that&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/Batucada">ran Mozilla Drumbeat</a>, once Mozilla&rsquo;s community, communication, and project management software. Lernanta contains the features of many learning management platforms: user profiles, courses, schools, certification (or at least, badges). But as its origins in Drumbeat might suggest, Lernanta facilitates community management &ndash;how people participate, what people and projects they follow.</p>
<p>gRSShopper, on the other hand, is a piece of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism">ur-MOOC</a>&nbsp;infrastructure (language really&nbsp;<a href="http://theory.cribchronicles.com/2012/05/02/the-problem-with-edx-a-mooc-by-any-other-name/">fails</a>&nbsp;here) &ndash; that is, MOOCs as formulated and offered by Downes, Siemens, Cormier, Couros, et al. And to clarify again, if you&rsquo;ve subscribed to the newsletters associated with these MOOCS &ndash; with LAK12, Change11, OLDaily, and the like &ndash; then you&rsquo;ve received an email &ldquo;generated by gRSShopper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>gRSShopper, as Downes describes it, &ldquo;is a personal web environment that combines resource aggregation, a personal dataspace, and personal publishing. It allows you to organize your online content any way you want to, to import content - your own or others&rsquo; - from remote sites, to remix and repurpose it, and to distribute it as RSS, web pages, JSON data, or RSS feeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather than driving users to a course website or a learning platform for all their interactions, the users on gRSShopper &ldquo;are assumed to be outside the system for the most part,&rdquo; writes Downes, &ldquo;inhabiting their own spaces, and not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Slide from George Siemens, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2012/06/03/what-is-the-theory-that-underpins-our-moocs/">What is the Theory that Underpins&nbsp;Our&nbsp;MOOCs?</a>&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://mfeldstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Open-Online-Courses-as-New-Educative-Practice.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3365" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://mfeldstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Open-Online-Courses-as-New-Educative-Practice.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="322" /></a></p>
<p>That theory underpins gRSShopper.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to make too much of the difference between the learner-focused gRSShopper and the community-oriented Lernanta. Sure, there is plenty of difference, but I don't think Lernanta is quite as demonstrative of P2PU theory as gRSShopper is for connectivism. And too, both these are both open source systems serving OER communities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another gulf again between these two systems and the new Stanford-model-MOOCs. (Although&nbsp;<a href="http://mitx.mit.edu/">MITx</a>&nbsp;&ndash; and now presumably&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/05/02/mitx-harvard-edx/">edX</a>&nbsp;&ndash; does say it will open source its MOOC platform (source code link?).) The latter MOOCs have recreated a traditional LMS in many ways for their technology platforms, driving (almost) all course activity onto their own course sites. Udacity does host its videos on YouTube. Otherwise, there&rsquo;s no RSS. There&rsquo;s no integration with external student blogs. The social or peer element involves primarily class forums. All work is done on and submitted via the platform.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say, I suppose, that learners couldn&rsquo;t take discussions elsewhere and adopt other tools &ndash; gRSShopper even &ndash; to do so. There's been some of this in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aiqus.com/">early community forums</a>&nbsp;(again with the forums!) that grew out of the Stanford AI and Machine Learning classes, and I&rsquo;m curious to see if learners will bubble out beyond the confines of the tech platform once Coursera offers more humanities and social science classes. &nbsp;Bookmarking, blogging, social media, RSS - will the new MOOCs open to these technologies?</p>
