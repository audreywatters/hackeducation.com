<p>I&#8217;m halfway through my annual series on the year&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">Top Ed-Tech Trends</a>&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/">all the stories that we&#8217;ve been told about education technology and the future of education in 2017</a>. Perhaps you&#8217;re overwhelmed by the word count. I know I am.</p>

<p>This means it&#8217;s also time to post my annual reminder that the work I do on Hack Education is supported almost entirely through readers&#8217; donations. </p>

<p>Full disclosure: I also subsidize this site through speaking gigs, and for the 2017&#8211;18 academic year, I am a <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/03/31/spencer-fellow">Spencer Education Journalism Fellow at the Columbia School of Journalism</a>. Someone recently called that a &#8220;cushy&#8221; gig, which is sort of weird. I work non-stop. Seriously. Seven days a week. You can look at <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters">my GitHub commits</a>: I have not skipped a day of work in over a year. The hustle doesn&#8217;t stop because I have a fellowship. It can&#8217;t. </p>

<p>I love what I do, but it&#8217;s not easy work. It&#8217;s certainly not &#8220;cushy.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways you can support my writing: You can make a donation <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">via PayPal</a> or become a monthly subscriber. I also have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/audreywatters">Patreon account</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/8/16752670/patreon-defends-new-pricing-after-user-uproar">although Patreon seems to be in the process of screwing us all over</a> so maybe hold off on using that site. Hooray! Freelancer economy!) <a href="http://audreywatters.com/books/">You can buy my books</a>. You can invite me to speak at your event or at your school &#8211; although I&#8217;m not accepting any speaking engagements until the Fall 2018.</p>

<p>I have Hack Education stickers that I can send you as a gesture of &#8220;thanks,&#8221; whether you contribute financially or not. (There will be a new pigeon sticker and logo coming in the new year, so maybe hold off on that request too.)</p>

<p>But I don&#8217;t want to be in the sticker business. I want to write education technology criticism. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support">Your support helps me continue to do that</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you. </p>
