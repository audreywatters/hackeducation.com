<p>I&rsquo;m starting to get more than a little grumpy about MOOCs, what with all the hype about the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/the-big-idea-that-can-revolutionize-higher-education-mooc/256926/">revolutionary</a> <a href="http://www.anthrocode.com/2012/06/udacity-udemy-moocs-disrupt.html">disruptions</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/education/consortium-of-colleges-takes-online-education-to-new-level.html?pagewanted=all">game-changing</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/opinion/brooks-the-campus-tsunami.html">tsunamis</a>. I&rsquo;m tired of the mainstream media punditry and their predictions that Stanford University&rsquo;s experiments with online education (and by extension now&nbsp;<a href="http://coursera.org">Coursera</a> and <a href="http://udacity.com">Udacity</a>) will change everything; I&rsquo;m tired of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s exuberance that this could mark the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2012/07/17/is-coursera-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-traditional-higher-education/">end-of-the-(academic)-world-as-we-know-it</a> &ndash; a future that its press, its investors, and its entrepreneurs are all invested (sometimes literally) in being both high tech and highly lucrative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a great frame of mind for me to start off two new Coursera classes today, both from the University of Michigan: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/fantasysf">Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/insidetheinternet">Internet History, Technology and Security</a>. I&rsquo;ve sat down to watch the first week&rsquo;s lecture videos this evening, but it&rsquo;s hard to do so without stewing about all the ink that&rsquo;s been spilled over in the last week or so &ndash; most of it focused on the institutional impact and little of it focused on the learner.</p>
<p>Oh sure, there&rsquo;s the promise that these free online courses will somehow liberate students from the shackles of tuition and student loan debt. But to quote President George W. Bush, &ldquo;rarely is the question asked: is our children learning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A recent article in <em><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/overblown-claims-of-failure-watch-how-not-to-gauge-the-success-of-online-courses/260159/">The Atlantic</a></em> posits that when we raise our eyebrows at the high drop-out rates in these online classes, we may be missing the point. The low completion rates are &ldquo;just as it should be&rdquo; and &ldquo;what they do tell us is that lots of people are aspirational learners &ndash; a fact we should celebrate in its own right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While aspiring to learn is, indeed, worth celebrating, I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone seriously argue that aspiring to learn is sufficient. Yet <em>The Atlantic</em> suggests the low success rates are &ldquo;a sign of the system&rsquo;s efficiency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And perhaps as these MOOCs are all just experiments &ndash; hyped experiments, but experiments nonetheless &ndash; we can shrug and say it&rsquo;s great folks want to learn and, alas, it&rsquo;s a pity when they don&rsquo;t. Perhaps. But when we praise the failure to complete a class (a failure to learn) as &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; and simply stop there, then I&rsquo;m not sure what we&rsquo;re building with MOOCs even rises to the level of what <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/confessions-community-college-dean/moocs-here">Dean Dad calls</a> a &ldquo;useful extra.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure we can even know that it&rsquo;s useful at all.</p>
<p>How do we know if students are learning &ndash; even those who complete the courses? After all, <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/05/early-demographic-data-hints-what-type-student-takes-mooc">students who sign up</a> for these classes come from a variety of disciplinary and professional backgrounds, with different educational experiences and degrees. Case in point: me, with a Master&rsquo;s Degree in Folkore, having taught both folklore and science fiction classes at the college level enrolled in this Fantasy and Science Fiction class. If I drop out of this class, is it really an indication that it is &ldquo;all praise the MOOC dropout, our best indication yet of system just beginning to find its footing&rdquo;? Is it a failure on my part? On the part of the course? On the part of the instructor? The content? The platform?</p>
<p>No one will know. And more troubling, no one seems to be really asking.</p>
<p>(PS. &nbsp;I'm not dropping out of your class, Dr. Chuck.)</p>
