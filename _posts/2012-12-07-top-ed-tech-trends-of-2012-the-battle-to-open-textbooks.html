<h3>Digital Textbooks</h3>
<br />
<p>When I looked at the most significant trends in educational technology last year, I opted to write about the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/07/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2011-the-digital-library">Digital Library</a>&rdquo; in lieu of digital textbooks. And truth be told, it would be quite easy for me to make the same argument again in 2012: despite all the hype about &ldquo;revolutionizing&rdquo; the textbook, faculty and students are still slow to adopt digital versions. (Not to mention, sorry, but&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/banality-textbooks">textbooks, yuck</a>.)</p>

<p>In May, the Book Industry Study Group released the <a href="http://www.bisg.org/news-5-750-press-releasecollege-faculty-continue-their-love-affair-with-print-textbooks-says-new-bisg-study.php">results</a> of &ldquo;a first ever survey of college faculty perceptions toward classroom materials&rdquo; that found that most professors (88%) still prefer (and assign) the printed versions of textbooks and other class materials. The survey also found that while 32% of faculty reported making digital versions of textbooks available, just 2% of students said this was the primary way in which they accessed the materials.</p>

<p>Digital textbook provider Coursesmart issued a <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/college-students-boost-digital-adoption-according-to-coursesmart-survey-153042715.html">press release</a> the same month with (not surprisingly) a sunnier view on adoption and usage. Coursesmart said that among the students it surveyed, more said they were likely to bring a laptop (51%) than a print textbook (39%) to class. Coursesmart&rsquo;s survey also found that the vast maority students owned some sort of technology &mdash; laptop, phone, e-reader &mdash; which they used to study. But as <a href="http://www.the-digital-reader.com/2012/05/23/students-using-buying-digital-textbooks-coursesmart-survey-shows">The Digital Reader&rsquo;s Nate Hoffelder noted</a>, taking a closer look at the actual survey data, there&rsquo;s a huge gap between <em>using</em> technology to study and <em>buying</em> digital textbooks. Students are definitely doing the former; <a href="http://www.the-digital-reader.com/2012/03/22/uk-students-arent-buying-ebooks">the latter, not so much</a>.</p>
