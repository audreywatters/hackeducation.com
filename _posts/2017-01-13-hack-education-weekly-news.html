Legislation in <strong>Iowa</strong> would end tenure even for those who already have it.&#8221; (&#8220;If colleges keep killing <strong>academic freedom</strong>, civilization will die, too,&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/if-colleges-keep-killing-academic-freedom-civilization-will-die-too/2017/01/10/74b6fcc2-d2c3-11e6-9cb0-54ab630851e8_story.html?utm_term=.fe880fca0239">says Judge Jos√© A.

Who drive the bright people out of our so-called scene
Till all that&#8217;s left is a meaningless fad</p>
