<p>I&rsquo;m halfway through my year-end review of (what I think are) <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com">the important trends in education technology in 2014</a>.</p>
<p>The word count for the series so far hovers around 25,000, and I have a lot more to say. (I&rsquo;m sorry. You&rsquo;re welcome.)</p>
<p>This project is a substantial undertaking, but I think it&rsquo;s important to spend the time compiling an overview and analysis of &ldquo;what happened,&rdquo; particularly as the education technology industry seems prone to forget the past so quickly.</p>
<p>I learn an incredible amount in the process of writing this series, and I see things that I might not otherwise. I hope that, in turn, the series offers the same to my readers.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I&rsquo;d like to remind folks about the &ldquo;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">donate</a>&rdquo; button on this site.</p>
<p>I purposefully keep Hack Education advertising-free. Unlike many other technology blogs, Hack Education isn&rsquo;t owned by a major technology or media company. I don&rsquo;t take sponsorship dollars to promote certain posts or products. I have not taken investment money from the same venture capitalists who fund education/technology companies. I am an independent voice.</p>
<p>This fall I was awarded a <a href="https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/">Shuttleworth Foundation Flash Grant</a>, which provided me with $5000 in support of the &ldquo;open thinking&rdquo; I do here on Hack Education. To receive the grant was a huge honor &ndash; and a big surprise. See, while I&rsquo;m hammering out all these words and crafting all these sentences and making all these arguments and picking all these fights on the Internet, I tend to forget that I have to remind people that they can <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">support my work</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to all those who&rsquo;ve donated throughout the year and to those who&rsquo;ve purchased <em><a href="http://monsters.hackeducation.com">The Monsters of Education Technology</a></em>. Your generosity helps make my work possible.</p>
<p>And thanks, of course, to everyone for reading.</p>
