<p>This is <strong>Reich&#8217;s Law</strong>: students who do stuff do better than student&#8217;s who don&#8217;t do stuff. Thank you, big data, for giving people this insight.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another example of the terrible potential (and the terribly obvious potential) of <strong>predictive analytics</strong>. <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-08-29-application-essays-can-help-students-get-into-college-could-they-also-predict-their-success">Edsurge writes about</a> <strong>application essays</strong>, asking if these could predict students&#8217; success. It seems likely, however, if schools think that there&#8217;s something in an application essay that predicts a student won&#8217;t be successful or that they&#8217;re likely to drop out that schools will be unlikely to admit them in the first place.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/genius-alternative-social-media/65695">ProfHacker writes about</a> &#8220;<strong>Genius</strong> as an Alternative <strong>Social Media</strong>,&#8221; but if you&#8217;re looking for <a href="https://www.inc.com/oscar-raymundo/bro-culture-at-companies.html">bro-free</a> social media, I&#8217;d recommend looking elsewhere.</p>

<p>Speaking of bro culture company tech, &#8220;<strong>Oculus</strong> is bringing its Rift and Go VR headsets to classrooms around the world,&#8221; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17792166/oculus-vr-rift-go-headsets-education-classrooms-taiwan-japan-seattle">says The Verge</a>.</p>

<p>And speaking of social media, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/health/tobacco-social-media-smoking.html">The New York Times writes about</a> &#8220;<strong>Big Tobacco</strong>&#8217;s Global Reach on Social Media&#8221; and in particular how young people are being targeted. There&#8217;s a lot to think about here, as <a href="https://twitter.com/natashanyt/status/1034077416195538947">Natasha Singer rightly pointed out on Twitter</a>, as this might related to Big Ed-Tech. But I think it&#8217;s worth noting too that <strong>Juul</strong>, one of the vaping companies marketing itself to teens, has a whole <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/14/the-promise-of-vaping-and-the-rise-of-juul"><strong>&#8220;mindfulness&#8221; curriculum</strong></a>. (So a real special shout-out to everyone in this week&#8217;s news who is trying to convince y&#8217;all that social emotional learning and mindfulness are some sort of progressive path forward.)</p>
