<p><em>Sorry for the delay in posting this round-up of the week&rsquo;s education news. I spent the week in Maine with family (my mom turned 70), with limited access to the Internet. As always, you can stay up on the blogs that I&rsquo;m reading, via the <a href="http://hackeducation.com/news">News Elsewhere tab</a> above or via this site&rsquo;s <a href="http://twitter.com/edufirehose">&ldquo;firehose&rdquo; Twitter account</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>While in Maine I was also incredibly fortunate to spend an afternoon with my hero Seymour Papert. I shared with him not just the outline of my book, <a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a>, but also my review unit of the latest LEGO Mindstorms. Write-up forthcoming&hellip;</em></p>
<h2>Testing and Pricing</h2>
<p>The Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (<strong>PARCC</strong>) <a href="http://parcconline.org/assessment-cost-estimates">unveiled the costs</a> of its <strong>Common Core</strong> tests in math and language arts this week: $29.50 per student. That&rsquo;s more than what half of its member states are currently paying for standardized testing. More details <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2013/07/parcc_test_cost_higher_for_half_.html">via Ed Week&rsquo;s Catherine Gewertz</a>, who also looks at the price tag for the other testing consortium&rsquo;s tests. She notes that PARCC &ldquo;seeks to make the point that $29.50 isn&rsquo;t a lot to spend on a test, noting that it&rsquo;s about the same as &rsquo;a movie date&rdquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;dinner for four at a fast-food restaurant,&rsquo;" which isn&rsquo;t exactly the analogy I think works best for arguing how we should spend education dollars, but what do I know.</p>
<h2>Education Politics</h2>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong> became the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=205548324">latest state to back out of <strong>PARCC</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong> Senator (and potential Presidential candidate in 2016) Marco Rubio has <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rubio-comes-out-against-common-core-putting-him-at-odds-with-jeb-bush/2133354">come out against the <strong>Common Core State Standards</strong>,</a> putting him at odd with former Florida Governor (another potential Presidential candidate) Jeb Bush.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Miami Dade Library System</strong>&nbsp;will&nbsp;<a href="http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2013/07/budgets-funding/miami-dade-library-to-close-nearly-half-its-branches/">close nearly half its branches</a>&nbsp;due to budget shortfalls. And hey, good luck potential Presidential candidates from&nbsp;<strong>Florida</strong>&nbsp;running on an education platform!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/07/25/obama-vows-shake-higher-education-and-find-new-ways-limit-costs"><strong>President Obama</strong> vows to &ldquo;shake up higher education.&rdquo;</a> <a href="http://gerrycanavan.wordpress.com/2013/07/25/oh-good-2/">Oh, good</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/07/23/for-profit-colleges-contributions-house-regulations/2579041/">The USA Today reports</a> that members of the <strong>House Education Committee</strong> are on the receiving end of a upswing in campaign donations from for-profit universities. (And in related news, committee members have put forward the &ldquo;Supporting Academic Freedom through Regulatory Relief Act,&rdquo; which will stop the Obama Administration from cutting off federal aid to schools with high graduate debt and low repayment ratios.)</p>
<p>The <strong>North Carolina</strong> legislature reached a budget deal that would allow school vouchers beginning in 2014, that would <a href="http://www.wral.com/house-senate-reach-agreement-on-balanced-state-budget/12686564/">end teacher tenure in the state</a>, and that earmarks $5.1 million for Teach For America.</p>
<p>The <strong>Chicago School District</strong> is <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/07/19/203695572/chicago-schools-hit-with-new-round-of-layoffs">laying off</a> 2000+ employees, including about 1000 teachers.</p>
<h2>Education Company Press Releases</h2>
<p><strong>Politico</strong> has launched a new <a href="https://www.politicopro.com">&ldquo;pro&rdquo; education vertical</a> with some awesome education journalists, including former Inside Higher Ed reporter Libby Nelson and former Reuters reporter Stephanie Simon. No word yet on the subscription price for the new service, which offers a daily round-up of education-related news, as well as more in-depth coverage.</p>
<p>The California charter school chain <strong>Aspire</strong> has spun out a startup called <strong>Schoolzilla</strong> to help teachers make better &ldquo;data-driven&rdquo; decisions. More <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2013/07/24/aspire-charter-schools-cuts-data-tech-schoolzilla-loose.aspx">via THE Journal</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><br />The <strong>Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas</strong> is offering a <a href="http://open.journalismcourses.org/index.php">MOOC on data journalism</a>, beginning August 12.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">7 <strong>Indian Institutes of Technology</strong> and a number of IT firms, including Infosys and Cognizant, are <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-07-19/news/40681617_1_seven-older-iits-nptel-andrew-thangaraj">teaming up to offer MOOCs</a>.</p>
<p>Be sure to tune in to the <a href="http://wcetblog.wordpress.com/">WCET blog</a> in the coming weeks for details on how <strong>ACE</strong> (the American COuncil on Education) has assessed five <strong>Coursera</strong> courses. (Kudos to Pat Book, ACE&rsquo;s former Assistant Vice President, for authoring the posts and for encouraging this level of transparency about the accreditation process.)</p>
<h2>Non-MOOCs, College Sports, and For-Profits Colleges</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.minervaproject.com/">The Minerva Project</a></strong>, a for-profit education startup that says it aims to be a new &ldquo;Ivy,&rdquo; has partnered with <strong>Keck Graduate Institute</strong> and will launch the Minerva Schools at KGI with the first class matriculating in the fall of 2015. (I covered the school&rsquo;s initial funding back in 2012 <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/new-elite-university-gets-25-million-seed-funding">here</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/college-football/news/20130722/grand-canyon-university-pac-12-protest/">Sports Illustrated reports</a> that the <strong>Pac&ndash;12</strong> conference&rsquo;s presidents have sent a letter to the <strong>NCAA</strong> asking it to &ldquo;engage in further, careful consideration&rdquo; before allowing for-profit universities to become Division I members. While this issue is under consideration, the schools say they will not schedule games against for-profit (new Division I member) <strong>Grand Canyon University</strong>. Of course, it&rsquo;s difficult to argue that college sports aren&rsquo;t a hugely profitable business, so the sneering at Grand Canyon University is a little rich.</p>
<h2>Revenues, Funding, and Acquisitions</h2>
<p>Language-learning giant <strong>Rosetta Stone</strong> has <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/07/25/rosetta-stone-buys-lexia-learning-to-move-beyond-foreign-language-learning/">acquired</a> Boston-based startup <strong>Lexia Learning</strong> for $22.5 million. Lexia Learning makes literacy software, so it looks as though Rosetta Stone might be returning to its pre-airport-kiosk roots: selling software to schools. Or perhaps we&rsquo;ll see more learn-to-read kiosks appear in malls and airports. I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson</strong> posted <a href="http://www.pearson.com/news/2013/july/pearson-2013-half-year-results.html?article=true">a report</a> on its finances from the first-half of 2013: sales are up 5%. Its education division grew by 3%. Its education digital platform registrations up 19%. So far, it doesn&rsquo;t appear that all these new education technology startups have disrupted Pearson yet. Hmm. Go figure.</p>
<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/07/24/class-notes-marketplace-flashnotes-raises-1-5-million-and-acquires-competitor-noteutopia/">The Next Web reports</a> that the class notes marketplace <strong>Flashnotes</strong> has closed a $1.5 million seed round of investment and has acquired a rival startup, <strong>Noteutopia</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-07-24-ellevation-raises-2-35-million">Edsurge reports</a> that <strong>Ellevation</strong>, which offers ELL software, has raised $2.35 million in funding.</p>
<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p><strong>Margaret Spellings</strong>, <strong>President George W. Bush</strong>&rsquo;s Secretary of Education, will be taking over the president&rsquo;s foundation and policy institute this fall, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/06/margaret-spellings-george-w-bush-foundation_n_3396591.html">according to The Huffington Post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lt. John Pike</strong>, <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/04/21/ed-tech-weekly-news-roundup-4-21/">UC Davis&rsquo;s infamous &ldquo;pepper spray cop,&rdquo;</a> is <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/07/26/cop-who-pepper-sprayed-uc-davi.html">requesting workers&rsquo; compensation</a> because he suffered psychiatric injury from the event.</p>
<p><a href="http://jonathanpelto.com/2013/07/25/supreme-court-leaves-vallas-in-place-during-appeal-process/">The Connecticut Supreme Court has decided</a> that <strong>Paul Vallas</strong> can stay in office as Bridgeport&rsquo;s superintendent of schools while he appeals a decision of a lower-court judge that ruled he was unqualified for the position and had to vacate it immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Nate Silver </strong>is <a href="http://frontrow.espn.go.com/2013/07/nate-silver-renowned-statistician-author-and-founder-of-fivethirtyeight-joins-espn-in-multi-faceted-role/">leaving The New York Times for ESPN</a>. <a href="http://scholasticadministrator.typepad.com/thisweekineducation/2013/07/nate-silvers-genius-isnt-math-its-journalism.html">Let me echo those</a> who really hope he&rsquo;ll write more about education testing.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p><strong>Sallie Mae</strong> and Ipsos Public Affairs released a survey this week about the amount that families pay for college, finding that the amount &ldquo;leveled off for the school year that ended this summer after falling between 2009 and 2012. For the most recent year, families paid an average of $21,178,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/07/23/salle-mae-survey-finds-families-unwilling-pay-more-higher-education">writes Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>OECD</strong> is weighing standardized testing higher education students around the world (because the whole <strong>PISA</strong> thing is working out so well, I guess). <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/world/europe/Should-University-Systems-Be-Graded-Too.html">More details in The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>How much time do schools spend on <strong>standardized testing</strong>? <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/07/25/how-much-time-do-school-districts-spend-on-standardized-testing-this-much/">According to a new report by the AFT</a>, &ldquo;The grade-by-grade analysis of time and money invested in standardized testing found that test prep and testing absorbed 19 full school days in one district and a month and a half in the other in heavily tested grades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Digital textbook provider <strong>Coursesmart</strong> has <a href="http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2013/survey-college-students-relying-more-on-digital-materials/">released its annual survey</a> on digital textbooks and devices is out. Among the findings: 99% of students surveyed own at least one digital device, with 68% saying they use 3 or more devices every day. 79% of those surveyed say they&rsquo;re using a digital textbook, up from 63% in 2011.

<p>The <strong>UK Department of Education</strong> has released statistics on the number of students expelled from primary schools, prompting some newspapers to offer some hand-wringing headlines about bad students and bad teachers.. But <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check/2013/jul/26/expulsions-british-schoolchildren-violent-trends">The Guardian</a> offers a more measured analysis, as well as the data you can download and explore yourself.</p>
<p><strong>College enrollment is down</strong>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/education/in-a-recovering-economy-a-decline-in-college-enrollment.html">The New York Times is on it</a>.</p>
<h2>Universities, Surveillance, and Security</h2>
<p><strong>Stanford University</strong> says it is investigating a security breach of its technology infrastructure, and &ldquo;as a precautionary measure, we are asking all users of Stanford&rsquo;s computer system &ndash; that is, all those with a SUNet, or Stanford University Network, ID &ndash; to change their passwords.&rdquo; More details <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/stanford-university-hacked/">via Techcrunch</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MIT</strong> President <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V133/N29/swartz/reifletter.html">Rafael Reif has penned an open letter</a> to explain why the university has intervened in a FOIA case for more information pertaining to the prosecution of Internet activist <strong>Aaron Swartz</strong>: &ldquo;We are not trying to stop the public release of these documents. We are simply asking for the opportunity to look at them carefully so we can be confident that the proper redactions have been made, so that releasing them does not pose a risk to MIT employees who became involved in the case in the course of simply doing their jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Dissertation Publishing</h2>
<p><strong>The American Historical Association</strong> <a href="http://blog.historians.org/2013/07/american-historical-association-statement-on-policies-regarding-the-embargoing-of-completed-history-phd-dissertations/">issued a statement</a> this week on the embargoing of history dissertations. It &ldquo;strongly encourages graduate programs and university libraries to adopt a policy that allows the embargoing of completed history PhD dissertations in digital form for as many as six years.&rdquo; To do otherwise would spell <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/07/26/despite-warnings-young-scholars-could-be-doomed-open-access-dissertations-evidence">DOOM!</a> for young scholars. Or something. So much for the move towards more open access publishing, eh? <a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/07/26/dissertation-embargoes-and-the-rights-of-scholars-aha-smacks-the-hornets-nest/">Rick Anderson</a>, <a href="http://edwired.org/2013/07/26/the-aha-and-open-access-scholarship/">Mills Kelly</a>, <a href="http://blogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/blog/2013/07/24/historians-dont-have-to-live-in-the-past/">Timothy Burke</a>, <a href="http://blog.historians.org/2013/07/why-put-at-risk-the-publishing-options-of-our-most-vulnerable-colleagues">William Cronon</a>, <a href="http://blog.historians.org/2013/07/why-put-at-risk-the-publishing-options-of-our-most-vulnerable-colleagues/#comment-24629">Sherman Dorn</a>, <a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/publishing-dissertation-online/51361">Adeline Koh</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dancohen/status/359394119417741312">Dan Cohen</a>, and much of academic Twitter have weighed in.</p>
