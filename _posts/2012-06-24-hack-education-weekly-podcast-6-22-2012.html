<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week. &nbsp;This week, we weren't virtual -- we were sitting together at the San Diego Convention Center. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this means the sound quality is pretty poor on this recording, particularly as you can hear the sounds in the background of the final preparations for ISTE 2012.</p>

<p><br />ISTE 2012 was the topic of much our conversation, as were my stories on <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/21/unow-and-the-mythologies-of-higher-ed/">UniversityNow</a>, the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/22/ed-tech-and-the-3-laws-of-robotics/">3 laws of ed-tech robotics</a>, and <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/20/codenow-/">CodeNow</a>.&nbsp;</p>
