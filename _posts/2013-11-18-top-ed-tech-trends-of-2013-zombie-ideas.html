<h3>The End</h3>
<br />
<p>It&rsquo;s time once again for my annual review of the dominant trends in education technology. This will be the fourth year of my penning this series &ndash; long enough for me to feel like it&rsquo;s become a veritable year-end tradition, and long enough for me to reflect beyond the single year in the arc of recent ed-tech history.</p>
<p>When I first started writing about the top trends &ndash; way back in 2010 &ndash; we were in the early days of a significant resurgence in ed-tech adoption and ed-tech entrepreneurship. I struggled then to convince editors that I should even cover the space. But soon enough, stories about the promise of education and technology filtered out beyond the tech or education trade press, and &ndash; thanks in no small part to Khan Academy &ndash; into the mainstream news as well. Oh sure, there were still lots of examples of schools banning computing devices and blocking websites (particularly social media). But there was a sense of excitement and promise among students, teachers, parents, principals, politicians, business folks, investors, journalists. Plus, as of the spring of 2010, there were iPads.</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> changed everything. Or something like that. &ldquo;The iPad will revolutionize education,&rdquo; or so the headlines promised. But three years later, as I plan this end-of-year review, I&rsquo;m struck by how very little has changed at all.</p>
