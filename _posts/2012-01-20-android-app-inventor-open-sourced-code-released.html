<p>Last year, Google decided to <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/more-wood-behind-fewer-arrows.html">shutter Google Labs</a>, a place where a number of incredibly wonderful experimental projects lived. &nbsp;Among the projects that got the ax was one of my favorites: &nbsp;Google's Android App Inventor. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, The New York Times' David Pogue gave it one of his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12pogue.html">most scathing reviews ever</a>. &nbsp;But as this was something designed in part by Hal Abelson, one of the people behind <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> -- no doubt, the single best learn-to-program projects available to this day. &nbsp;And as such it was terribly disappointing to see the Android App Inventor be shelved. &nbsp;Much like Scratch, App Inventor presupposes zero programming knowledge, and yet while teaching computational thinking, it also allows users to build something they find both useful and important -- in the case of Scratch, it's animations and games. &nbsp;In the case of App Inventor, it's mobile apps.</p>
<p>After announcing the closure of App Inventor (<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/08/09/google-to-shut-down-educational-programming-tool-android-app-inventor/">news I broke here</a>), Google <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/08/16/android-app-inventor-saved-finds-a-new-home-at-mit/">handed over App Inventor to MIT</a>, along with a sizable donation to help fund a new mobile learning inititiative. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We haven't heard much publicly about the project since then (although those who are part of the App Inventor Google Group know that the questions "When? WHEN!?" have been fairly rampant)</p>
<p>Well, "when" is "now" when it comes to the release of the Android App Inventor source code. &nbsp;Google and MIT have just announced its release, and the source code is now available <a href="http://code.google.com/p/app-inventor-releases/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In a blog post on the <a href="http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/developers-blogs/hal/2012/jan/google-and-mit-announce-open-sourcing-app-inventor-code">new MIT site</a>, Abelson writes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Google and MIT are pleased to announce the initial free and open-source release from Google of the App Inventor source code at&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="http://code.google.com/p/app-inventor-releases/">http://code.google.com/p/app-inventor-releases/</a>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There's little supporting documentation yet, and we&rsquo;re not accepting contributions to the code now. That will happen later, after the MIT Center of Mobile Learning opens their App Inventor server to the public. We hope to nurture a robust and active open-source project eventually, but for now we don't want to distract the MIT developers from their efforts to complete and deploy the large-scale public server. In the meantime, we&rsquo;ll update the code periodically to match what&rsquo;s running at the latest MIT experimental system. We've also created a Google Group here for people working with the code to relate their experiences with the code, ask questions, help each other, etc.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>People who create modifications from this code base are free to use the term &ldquo;App Inventor&rdquo; and the puzzle-piece Android logo in their work. MIT will be releasing its own versions under the name &ldquo;MIT App Inventor&rdquo;, which is reserved for the systems actually coming from MIT.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Enjoy the code, and Happy Inventing!</em></p>
