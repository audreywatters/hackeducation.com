<p>Borders has partnered with <a href="http://www.chegg.com">Chegg</a> to offer textbook rentals to students via the Borders website.  Borders expanded its offerings earlier this year to try to nab a share of the new and used textbook market, and the partnership with Chegg gives students another option for acquiring textbooks.  The combined inventory will offer a lot of titles.  (And on a side note, if I were to say there's one thing that gives me hope for the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/can_the_kno_tablet_make_the_e-textbook_grade.php">Kno</a>, it's that its founder Osman Rashid also co-founded Chegg and as such has a good understanding of the textbook market.)</p>
<p>The Department of Education has finally released the National Education Technology Plan.  Hooray.  <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/11/11/ok-so-we-have-a-national-education-technology-plan-now-what/">We have a plan.  Now what?</a></p>
<p>The social learning network <a href="http://openstudy.com">OpenStudy</a> has rolled out a couple of new features, the most notable being a "public access" feature, meaning that you needn't register for the site in order to see the content in study groups or study pads.  "Throwing the doors open even further," reads the announcement.</p>
<p>HP will pay a $16 million settlement to the government as a result of a case of e-Rate fraud.  The Department of Justice found that HP had bribed schools in Texas with lavish gifts in order to win e-Rate contracts.</p>
<p>Hearst Publications' Cathie Black was named the new chancellor for the NYC Public Schools, replacing Joel Klein who stepped down and was quickly snatched up by News Corp.  I want to say something pithy about journalism and education transformation, but the two announcements make me rather ill.</p>
<p>But on a happier writing-and-ed-tech note, nominations for the <a href="http://edublogawards.com/">2010 Edublog Awards</a> are now open.</p>
