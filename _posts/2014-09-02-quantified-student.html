<h2>What is the Quantified Self Movement?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve written about this <a href="http://modernlearners.com/student-data-vs-student-privacy/">again and again</a> here at EML, but it bears repeating: thanks to our increasing use of  computer technologies, we are generating massive amounts of data. Almost  every time we search or click or buy or like or link online, data is  being collected about our transactions. As such companies know a lot  about us. The quantified self movement contends that a similar sort of  process can be undertaken by the individual &mdash; collecting and leveraging  data in order to know more about ourselves.</p>
<p>Although tracking  one&rsquo;s personal habits with technology is hardly new &mdash; think of the  diabetic&rsquo;s use of technology to measure blood sugar levels, for example &mdash;  the phrase &ldquo;quantified self movement&rdquo; was coined <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/66TEY49wv">in 2007</a>,  a reflection of the growing number of small sensors, mobile phones, and  applications that individuals could more easily access and adopt.</p>
<p>The  quantified self movement claims to be focused on learning about the  self, although much of its emphasis (as with many of its early adopters)  has been focused on health and workplace productivity, and less on what  we traditionally associate with &ldquo;education.&rdquo; Typically, the quantified  self movement frames this process of self-discovery as directed towards  something actionable &ndash; losing weight, training for a marathon, cutting  carbs, avoiding migraine headaches, writing a novel, and so on.</p>
<h2>How Might the Quantified Self Relate to Learning?</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://cdn.nmc.org/media/2014-nmc-horizon-report-he-EN-SC.pdf">2014 Horizon Report for Higher Education</a> posits that the quantified self movement is one of the trends on the 4 to 5 year horizon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With  the growing use of mobile apps and wearable technology, individuals are  creating an exponentially increasing amount of data. The quantified  self movement is breaking ground by integrating these data streams in  interesting ways. Self quantifiers, for example, can create healthier  living plans after monitoring their sleep, exercise, diet, and other  important patterns. The new mobile app Whistle even enables people to do  the same for their dogs. It is imaginable that if test scores and  reading habits gleaned from learning analytics could be combined with  other lifestyle tracking information, these large data sets could reveal  how environmental changes improve learning outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But  the question of how the quantified self relates to learning is still  actually an open question. Ideally, the answer is dictated by what the  individual &mdash; what someone wants to know, to track, or to learn.</p>
<p>You  could track what you read, for example. Think of all that your Amazon  Kindle knows about your reading habits: what you read, when you read,  how much you read, where you stop, what you highlight, what you  annotate. Or you could track what you write: how many words, how many  pages, when you write, how much gets scrapped or tweaked, which verbs or  adjectives you tend to overuse, how your phrasing falls into certain  patterns (for better or for worse). You could also track your personal  learning network: who you follow, what you say, whose links you tend to  click on and actually read, who you ask for help and how quick they are  to respond.</p>
<p>Of course, none of these necessarily mean you&rsquo;re <em>learning</em>.</p>
<h2>So We&rsquo;re All Quantified&hellip;Now What?</h2>
<p>After  you&rsquo;ve collected your data and quantified your actions, then what?  Typically you visualize and/or analyze it. The idea is to actually be  able to do something with what you discover &ndash; diagnose, moderate,  modulate, improve, act.</p>
<p>The quantified self movement does put the  data collection and the analysis into the hands of the individual. That  certainly runs counter to the way in which data collection and analysis  typically works in schools: schools &mdash; and more accurately, the software  applications they utilize &mdash; collect the data. <em>Schools decide the goals</em>. Schools &mdash; or again, the software &mdash; run the analysis.</p>
<p>It  is possible that framing this in terms of the  student-as-quantified-self could mean that an individual learner would  have better control over their own data collection, goals, and analysis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <em>possible</em>.</p>
<h2>Do We Even Want "Quantified Learners"?</h2>
<p>But  how will learners know what to track? Would learners, as quantified  students, track new things in new ways? In other words, would this  actually be transformational? Or would they simply reinscribe  traditional school goals through traditional measurements &mdash; tracking  grades, for example, tracking assignments, tracking time spent doing  homework.</p>
<p>While the quantified self movement has been incredibly  empowering for some people who wanted to gain better control over their  health, it&rsquo;s not clear that it&rsquo;s a model that can be neatly transferred  to education. Is there the same sort of understanding about what matters  to our intellectual health as what matters to our physical health? Do  we know what to track in order to aid, to diagnose, to maximize our own  learning?</p>
<p>Of course, you could just take a page from Stephen Wolfram or Gordon Bell and just <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/03/opinion-wolfram-life-analytics/all/1">track everything</a>,  creating a repository of all of one's digital assets and metadata. If  nothing else, that might work in the service of boosting your analytical  skills.</p>
<p>And arguably &mdash;&nbsp;this is the promise of the quantified self  movement&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the process of collecting and analyzing itself would lead to  discovery about one&rsquo;s own learning. It&rsquo;s not necessary for us to have  the right questions (or the right answers) ahead of time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,  my concerns &mdash; and maybe &ldquo;concern&rdquo; is too strong a word &mdash; about the  combination of quantified self and learning involve the former's  fixation on transactional data. I worry that there's already too much  focus on the easily quantifiable but in the end meaningless signals we  create, something perhaps exacerbated now by technology.</p>
<p>There are  a lot of obvious numbers in our day-to-day lives &mdash; what we read, where  we click, what we like, how much time we spend studying, who we talk to  and ask for help. But in some ways, this is the "administrivia" of  education. We&rsquo;re already incredibly focused on &ldquo;data&rdquo; &mdash; on the things we  can quantify (mostly via standardized testing). Has quantification  really helped us uncover, let alone diagnose or augment learning? Would  giving learners better control over their data help do this?</p>
<p>What needs to happen to spur collection and reflection over our data so we <em>can</em> do a better job of this &mdash; of augmenting learning, again, not for the  sake of the institution or the software provider, but for the sake of  the individual?</p>
<p>Or is a move towards the quantified student, even  if it&rsquo;s framed as the quantified self, just a rebranding of a trend that  focuses on simple technological solutionism rather than on the more  difficult questions surrounding our own learning &mdash; questions that are  never so easily measurable?</p>
