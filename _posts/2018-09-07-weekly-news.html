<p><em>Each week, I gather a wide variety of links to education and education technology articles. All this feeds the mammoth review I write each December on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the stories we are told</a> about the future of education. I&#8217;ve probably missed a few of those stories this week as I am on vacation. But look how dutiful I am, still writing this list of shitty things that keep happening despite all the warnings I give.</em></p>
