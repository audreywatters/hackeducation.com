<p>Each week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to discuss the latest ed-tech news. This week's podcast was recorded "live in front of a studio audience" -- or something like that. Steve was in Portland for the kick-off of his "<a href="http://www.hackyoureducation.com/">Hack Your Education</a>" tour, so a handful of folks got to listen in on our conversation before the rest of y'all get to hear the podcast.</p>
<p>I didn't write much this past week, as I was sick and my work schedule <a href="/2012/09/10/techcrunch-disrupt-storified/">disrupted (har har har)</a>, but that hardly stopped Steve and me from filling an hour with discussions on startups, Silicon Valley, and strikes.</p>
<p>The link to the MP3 of the show is below, and/or you can subscribe to  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/edtechlive/hackeducation">the podcast feed</a>. You can also find the podcast in iTunes, as part of Steve's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/edtechlive/id219875737">EdTechLive series</a>.</p>
