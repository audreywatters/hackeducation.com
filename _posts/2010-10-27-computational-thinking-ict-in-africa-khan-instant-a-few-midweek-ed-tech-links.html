<p>Via <a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2010/10/khan-instant-instant-search-for-khan.html">Free Technology for Teachers</a>, there's now an instant search, a la <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/live_blog_google_search_event.php">Google Instant</a>, for <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> videos:  <a href="http://www.khaninstant.com/">Khan Instant</a>.</p>
<p>Google has launched a program to promote computational thinking at the K-12 level.  For more information, see the <a href="http://googleforstudents.blogspot.com/2010/10/exploring-computational-thinking.html">Google Student Blog</a>.</p>
<p>The World Bank's Ed-Tech blog has an interesting <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/edutech/egranary">story</a> about a project in Africa that brings digital education resources to places without adequate Internet.  The <a href="http://www.widernet.org/egranary/">eGranary Digital Library</a> -- "Internet in a box" -- has been installed in over 300 institutions in Africa.</p>
<p>The National Archives has launched a new site called <a href="http://docsteach.org/">DocsTeach</a> to help teachers use primary resources in the classroom.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-End-of-the-Textbook-as-We/125044/">Chronicle of Higher Education</a> reports that colleges will force a switch to digital textbooks in order to save money.  I have other moneysaving options but it involves axing subsidies for college football and ending expensive LMS and software licenses, so e-textbooks might be a more palatable option.</p>
<p>Amazon Kindle plans to let you loan your eBooks.  <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/amazon_kindle_will_let_you_lend_your_ebooks_once_m.php">Except not really</a>.</p>
