<br />
<p>I was recently informed that my pointing out the relationships between politics, tech investors, and their investment portfolio constitutes an &#8220;ad hominem&#8221; attack. But you&#8217;re full of fallacy yourself if you think that&#8217;s going to stop me from making critiques about this industry. Good grief. And while this isn&#8217;t directly related to education, it&#8217;s one of the most important stories from the tech industry this week (one that certainly could have major implications on my ability to do my research and writing): that is, Paypal co-founder <strong>Peter Thiel</strong> apparently <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/05/24/this-silicon-valley-billionaire-has-been-secretly-funding-hulk-hogans-lawsuits-against-gawker/#4c8bd58a7805">bankrolled</a> the recent <strong>libel</strong> lawsuit that Hulk Hogan won against <strong>Gawker</strong>, using his vast wealth to &#8211; he hoped &#8211; put the publication out of business. More via The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-tech-billionaire-reveals-secret-war-with-gawker.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-is-said-to-bankroll-hulk-hogans-suit-against-gawker.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/business/dealbook/gawker-founder-suspects-a-common-financer-behind-lawsuits.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-is-said-to-bankroll-hulk-hogans-suit-against-gawker.html">here</a>. <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/25/gawker-hogan-thiel/">Here&#8217;s media reporter Mathew Ingram&#8217;s take</a> (and there are lots of takes out there. My god. The takes). In addition to funding this lawsuit, Thiel sits <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/735261182823518208">on the board of <strong>Facebook</strong></a>, which itself is playing a huge role in the &#8220;<strong>future of news</strong>.&#8221; Thiel also a Trump supporter and will be a delegate at the upcoming Republican convention. (And Trump, for his part, also wants to make it easier to sue journalists for libel.) For those keeping score at home, here are Peter Thiel&#8217;s ed-tech investments (in addition to his &#8220;I&#8217;ll pay you to drop out of college&#8221; fellowship program, of course): Clever, Lore, Thinkful, Declara, and SoFi. He&#8217;s a partner at Founders Fund, which has invested in Knewton, AltSchool, Uversity, ResearchGate, If You Can, Upstart, Declara, and Affirm. But that&#8217;s all ad hominem and is irrelevant to the future of education. You wish.</p>
