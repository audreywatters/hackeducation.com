<p>Comic creation website and perennial teacher favorite <a href="http://www.chogger.com">Chogger</a> has just relaunched, with some big improvements to its interface and a new comic creator tool.</p>
<p>Chogger is a free, web-based tool that lets you build and public your own comics.  The creator tool works primarily as a drag-and-drop interface, and while it's a simple tool, there's actually quite a bit of functionality -- and room for creativity -- here.</p>
<p>Chogger gives you a number different panel layouts to choose from, for example -- a single panel or multiple ones.  You can add photos, images (drawn from the "safe" setting on Google Image Search), or draw your own figures; add speech balloons (which have been updated with this relaunch to include shout and thought bubbles); write captions and so on.  Each frame of your comic can be fully customized.</p>
<p>Chogger has also added a <a href="http://www.chogger.com/chogit">bookmarklet</a> to help you easily pull images from the Web to incorporate into your comics.</p>
<p>Recognizing that some of its biggest fans are teachers, Chogger is also planning to launch a new service <a href="http://www.classroomcomics.com">Classroom Comics</a> that will work well for teachers who want to have better control over their students' comic creation and publication.</p>
