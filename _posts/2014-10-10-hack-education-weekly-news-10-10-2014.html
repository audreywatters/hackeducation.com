<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say it&rsquo;s been a particularly difficult week for women in technology. The <strong>Grace Hopper Celebration</strong> decided to invite <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/10/09/technology-sexism-male-allies-grace-hopper-celebration">a panel of &ldquo;male allies&rdquo;</a> to talk about fixing sexism in tech. (Panel members included the CEO of <strong>GoDaddy</strong>, known best perhaps for its sexist advertising campaigns). <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/10/09/nadella-women-dont-ask-for-raise"><strong>Microsoft</strong> CEO Satya Nadella said</a> that women shouldn&rsquo;t ask for raises; they should trust &ldquo;karma.&rdquo; And tech educator <strong>Kathy Sierra</strong> deleted her Twitter account (@seriouspony), leaving behind a really chilling <a href="http://seriouspony.com/trouble-at-the-koolaid-point">blog post</a> (<a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/trolls-will-always-win/">Wired version</a>) about her ongoing experiences with harassment and trolling. In response, <strong>Adria Richards</strong> shared some of <a href="https://storify.com/adriarichards/telling-my-troll-story-because-kathy-sierra-left-t">her experiences with violent threats and harassment</a> as well.</p>
<p>Some people in education technology continue to dismiss this rampant misogyny as something that the tech sector suffers from but that education is somehow immune to. <em>Education and ed-tech are not immune</em>.</p>
<p><a title="Malala Yousafzai by Statsministerens kontor, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/statsministerenskontor/14395308166"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5526/14395308166_7a21f9b984.jpg" alt="Malala Yousafzai" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Malala Yousafzai</strong> <a href="http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/laureates/laureates-2014/announce-2014/">won the <strong>Nobel Peace Prize</strong> today</a> (sharing the prize with <strong>Kailash Satyarthi</strong>) for her work campaigning for girls&rsquo; right to an education. She is the youngest person to win the award. Yesterday marked the two year anniversary of her being shot by a Taliban gunman as she boarded her school bus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think of it often and imagine the scene clearly. Even if they come to kill me, I will tell them what they are trying to do is wrong, that education is our basic right.&rdquo; &ndash; Malala Yousafzai, in 2011 foreseeing the assassination attempt</em></p>

<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>The <strong>Philadelphia School Reform Commission</strong> canceled its teachers&rsquo; contract this week, prompting <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2014-10-09/news/54832395_1_teachers-contract-4-teachers-philadelphia-federation">students</a> in Philadelphia to go &ldquo;<a href="https://storify.com/billy_penn/philly-students-on-strike-for-their-teachers">on strike</a>&rdquo; in support of their teachers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/10/rand-paul-education-government-in-the-way">From Vanity Fair</a>: &ldquo;If Kentucky Senator and Republican presidential hopeful <strong>Rand Paul</strong> has his way, classroom sizes will someday rise well beyond their existing ratios of 15-to&ndash;1 or 30-to&ndash;1. &lsquo;I think we should go to a million to one,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Paul. I think he'd be a perfect keynote speaker for SXSWedu.</p>
<p>Protests in <strong>Mexico</strong> over the <a href="http://www.ei-ie.org/en/news/news_details/3267">disappearance</a> of 43 student-teachers. &ldquo;The students vanished after police and alleged gang members opened fire on their buses in the southern city of Iguala, located in the violence-plagued state of Guerrero. Six students were killed, while dozens of others were taken away in patrol cars to undisclosed locations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For-profit giant <strong>Kaplan University</strong> <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/For-Profit-Giant-Starts/149227/">launches</a> &ldquo;<strong>Open College</strong>,&rdquo; which &ldquo;will include free online services and personalized mentoring to help people identify and organize prior experience and skills that could count toward a degree or move them closer to a new career. It will also provide fee-based services, under a subscription model, that will offer ways for students to satisfy the remaining requirements for a bachelor of science degree in professional studies from Kaplan University.&rdquo; And it will also serve as the latest example of &ldquo;openwashing&rdquo; in education.</p>
<h2>Meanwhile on Campus</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_26666181/san-jose-states-costly-high-tech-upgrade-cisco">A stinging investigation by the San Jose Mercury News</a> into <strong>San Jose State University</strong>&rsquo;s dealings with <strong>Cisco</strong>: &ldquo;Pushed by its ambitious president, San Jose State is spending $28 million on high-tech communications systems worthy of a campus of the future &ndash; but an investigation by this newspaper shows the project was crafted largely in secret, purchased without competitive bids and adorned with pricey gadgets that many professors may not even use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beginning next year, <strong>Indiana University</strong>&rsquo;s Center for Postsecondary Research will produce the Carnegie Classifications,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/10/09/indiana-lumina-boost-take-over-carnegie-classifications">reports Inside Higher Ed</a>. (The <strong>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</strong> includes &ldquo;doctorate-granting universities,&rdquo; &ldquo;Master&rsquo;s Colleges and Universities,&rdquo; &ldquo;Baccalaureate Colleges,&rdquo; &ldquo;Associates Colleges,&rdquo; and &ldquo;NFL Training Campuses.&rdquo; OK. I made that last one up. Maybe the new classification system should include it though.)</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/149253/">The Chronicle</a>: &ldquo;<strong>The University of Maryland University College</strong>, fearing that it has lost its mojo as a dominant player in online education and suffering from recent enrollment declines, is considering converting itself into a private nonprofit institution.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p><strong>Chicago Teachers Union</strong> president <strong>Karen Lewis</strong> <a href="http://www.wbez.org/news/karen-lewis-hands-over-leadership-chicago-teachers-union-110919">has stepped aside</a> from her role due to a &ldquo;serious illness,&rdquo; handing over leadership of the union to its vice president, Jesse Sharkey. No details on the illness, and no word how this might affect a bid for mayor. Although she hasn&rsquo;t declared her candidacy, she had been exploring the idea and polls suggest she could beat current mayor <strong>Rahm Emanuel</strong>. (Get well soon, Karen.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.smarterbalanced.org/"><strong>Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium</strong></a>, one of the two Common Core assessment initiatives, says that its executive director Joe Willhoft is stepping down and will be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Tony Alpert.</p>

<h2>Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p><a href="http://the-digital-reader.com/2014/10/06/adobe-spying-users-collecting-data-ebook-libraries/#.VDWY8WddVu0">The Digital Reader&rsquo;s Nate Hoffelder</a> broke the story this week that <strong>Adobe Digital Editions</strong> has been collecting users&rsquo; reading data and sending it back to company servers in unencrypted text. It&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-28/">What You Should Know&hellip;</a>&rdquo; over on EML, and <a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2014/10/ebooks/librarians-experts-respond-adobe-spying-accusations/">The Digital Shift</a> has a good summary too about the privacy implications for readers and for libraries.</p>
<p>The <strong>Academy of Art University</strong> used to grant students permanent licenses for the <strong>Adobe</strong> CS6 Master Collection as part of their tuition. But apparently Adobe has <a href="http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/license-problem-jeopardizes-art-students-studies/nhQ5D/">deactivated these</a> licenses, without any warning, demanding students now pay a $60/month subscription fee to continue access.</p>
<p>Hackers have <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-hacked-the-snappening-2014-10">released</a> a cache of 13GB of <strong>Snapchat</strong> users&rsquo; photos. Although users believe Snapchats disappear after viewing, a third-party app has apparently been collecting these images for several years. About half of Snapchats&rsquo; users are <a href="http://digiday.com/platforms/snapchat-pitching-brands-agencies/">between age 13 and 17</a>. &ldquo;4chan users say the collection of photos has a large amount of child pornography, including many videos sent between teenagers who believed the files would be immediately deleted after viewing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-10-08-reflect-and-connect-wants-to-jumpstart-your-pln">Also from <strong>Edsurge</strong></a>: an app you can auth via your <strong>Twitter</strong> account that will tell you which educators to follow and what to read (on Edsurge).</p>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> has launched a &ldquo;<a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/10/09/github-rolls-out-free-student-developer-pack.aspx">Student Developer Pack</a>,&rdquo; offering a free Micro account along with discounts on a number of other developer tools.</p>
<p><strong>Tripod Education Partners</strong>, &ldquo;best known for its work on a well-publicized study of teacher effectiveness by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation,&rdquo; is <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/10/tripod_steps_into_world_of_teacher_surveys.html">launching</a> a survey tool for teachers. (It must have some hurt feelings that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/technology/students-grade-teachers-and-a-start-up-harnesses-the-data.html">The New York Times tech section gushed</a> about survey startups and didn&rsquo;t mention it or something.)</p>
<p><strong>Clever</strong> has partnered with the <strong>AFT</strong> to offer its single-sign-on service to the latter&rsquo;s <strong>ShareMyLesson</strong> platform &ndash; something that&rsquo;s <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/10/teaches_union_ed-tech_startup.html">oddly described in EdWeek</a> as OER. It&rsquo;s not. In fact, ShareMyLesson&rsquo;s terms of service are pretty terrible. Funnymonkey&rsquo;s Bill Fitzgerald has <a href="http://funnymonkey.com/blog/what-problems-get-solved-aft-clever-and-sharemylesson-collaboration">a number of questions</a> about the deal including &ldquo;What are the financial details of this arrangement? Is AFT getting paid by Clever, is Clever getting paid by AFT, and/or is there any outside funding helping to subsidize this work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill is on a roll, <a href="http://funnymonkey.com/blog/remind-privacy-certifications-privacy-policies-and-distributing-access-codes-social-media">with a look too at <strong>Remind</strong>&rsquo;s privacy policies</a>. On the heels of a $40 million investment in the messaging app <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/10/03/hack-education-weekly-news-10-3-2014/">last week</a>, it&rsquo;s definitely worth looking more closely at what happens to student, family, and teacher data.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a group of tech and textbook companies <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/student-privacy-tech-companies-111645.html">pinky-swear</a> they&rsquo;re not going to do bad things with students&rsquo; data. <strong>Amplify</strong> (News Corp) is <a href="http://studentprivacypledge.org/?page_id=22">on the list</a>, so um yeah. I totally believe them. Neither <strong>Apple</strong> <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/law-policy-and-it/should-google-be-signatory-student-privacy-pledge">nor <strong>Google</strong></a> nor <strong>Pearson</strong> nor <strong>Khan Academy</strong> signed. (Pearson did issue a press release &ldquo;applauding&rdquo; the idea. But <a href="http://www.pearsoned.com/pearson-applauds-siia-and-future-of-privacy-forum-for-student-privacy-effort/">I can&rsquo;t get it&rsquo;s website to load</a>. Go figure.)</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> has launched OneNote Class Notebook Creator, which PC World <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2707472/microsoft-follows-google-to-education-sector-with-office-365-app-for-teachers.html">describes</a> as &ldquo;a classroom assistance application for OneNote and SharePoint Online in Office 365&rdquo; and Microsoft describes as &ldquo;a flexible digital framework for teaching and learning.&rdquo; Right.</p>
