<h3>The State of the Union</h3>
<br />
<p>Tuesday night, <strong>President Obama</strong> gave the annual <strong>State of the Union</strong> pep-talk. Among the <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2015/01/20/375837171/what-to-expect-tonight-on-education">education-related proposals</a>: <strong>free community college</strong>, a law protecting student&#8217;s data and <strong>privacy</strong>, <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/151297/"></a>streamlined higher education <strong>tax credits</strong></a>, and <strong>universal pre-school</strong>.</p>

<p>Reponses: <a href="http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2015/01/state-of-union-and-corpus-comparison.html">Via Ben Schmidt</a>, the <strong>changing language</strong> over time in State of the Union addresses. Louisiana Governor <strong>Bobby Jindal</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyjindal/status/557693841537777666">makes the case</a> for the Common Core and for more rigorous grammar and punctuation instruction. <strong>John Boehner</strong> <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/general/12-taylor-swift-reactions-president-obamas-free-college-idea">invokes</a> <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> animated GIFs.</p>

<h3>Education Politics Elsewhere</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/01/22/schools-can-require-students-to-hand-over-their-social-media-passwords-under-illinois-law/">A new law in <strong>Illinois</strong></a> would require students hand over their <strong>social media passwords</strong> to schools if the school has reason to believe that their social media accounts have evidence she or he violated a school policy. <a href="http://www.pogowasright.org/new-illinois-law-gives-schools-access-to-students-social-media-passwords/">Even if it&#8217;s posted at home, after school hours</a>. Remind me again how the federal government is going to protect student privacy again?</p>

<p><strong>LAUSD</strong> <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2015/01/20/17831/controversial-ipad-emails-make-lausd-rethink-when/">announced</a> that it will keep <strong>email records</strong> for two years. Shortly after news broke about emails detailing close ties between former superintendent John Deasy and Pearson officials, the LAUSD Board voted to delete emails after one year. Some divisions can opt to keep their emails for longer than two years. Does storing email really take up that much space? Couldn&#8217;t the district just buy a couple 64 GB iPads to store the files?</p>

<p><strong>Chicago Public Schools</strong> will only give <a href="http://www.catalyst-chicago.org/notebook/2015/01/16/66262/defying-state-cps-will-test-just-10-percent-schools">10% of students</a> the new <strong>PARCC</strong> exam, going against the state of Illinois&#8217; decree that all students take the test.</p>

<p>The <strong>Wyoming</strong> House of Representatives is <a href="http://trib.com/news/local/education/wyoming-bill-that-repeals-science-standard-ban-advances/article_85bcf7bf-4b6b-50d8-9396-e323818a602c.html">taking steps</a> to overturn a budget provision that bans the state from adopting the <strong>Next Generation Science Standards</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>NYC</strong> Schools Chancellor <strong>Carmen Fariña</strong> is poised to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/22/nyregion/new-york-city-school-superintendents-authority-over-principals.html">re-centralize</a> a district hierarchy, making principals report to regional superintendents and reversing a policy of the Mayor Bloomberg / Joel Klein era.</p>

<p><strong>New York</strong> Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a number of new <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/01/21/cuomo-proposes-sweeping-education-reforms/">education reforms</a> &#8220;that would impose stricter teacher evaluations, extend the period of time to earn <strong>tenure</strong>, expand <strong>charter schools</strong> and boost state oversight of failing schools.&#8221; He will also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/nyregion/cuomo-to-offer-plan-to-cut-college-graduates-debt.html">propose legislation</a> to cut the student loan burden of state residents, with the state paying for two years of <strong>loan repayments</strong> for those who earn less than $50,000 a year. &#8220;Cuomo's Education Agenda Sets Battle Lines With <strong>Teachers' Unions</strong>,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/nyregion/cuomos-education-agenda-sets-battle-lines-with-teachers-unions.html">says The New York Times</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Vermont</strong> governor Peter Shumlin <a href="http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/27219/20150116/vermont-governor-would-outlaw-teacher-strikes">says</a> he wants to outlaw teachers going on <strong>strike</strong>.</p>

<h3>Ed-Tech and the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p>A lawsuit charging that <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Viacom</strong> illegally tracked kids using the Nickelodeon website has been dismissed, <a href="http://recode.net/2015/01/21/google-viacom-win-dismissal-of-suit-over-childrens-web-privacy/">reports Re/code</a>.</p>

<p>Tim McGettigan, a sociology professor at <strong>Colorado State University Pueblo</strong>, is suing the school for violating his <strong>free speech rights</strong>, charging that the university blocked his computer access after he tried to organize protests in response to planned layoffs. More on the story <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27321588/citing-free-speech-violations-csu-pueblo-professor-files?source=infinite">via The Denver Post</a>.</p>

<h3>Tech and Surveillance</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/healthcare.gov-sends-personal-data">Via the EFF</a>: &#8220;The Associated Press reports that <strong>healthcare.gov</strong>–the flagship site of the <strong>Affordable Care Act</strong>, where millions of Americans have signed up to receive health care–is quietly <strong>sending personal health information to a number of third party websites</strong>. The information being sent includes one&#8217;s zip code, income level, smoking status, pregnancy status and more.&#8221; Remind me once again how the federal government is going to protect student privacy? </p>

<p>After initially refusing to sign <strong>Google</strong> has now <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/01/after_initially_holding_out_go.html">added its name</a> to the list of companies who&#8217;ve signed a &#8220;<strong>student privacy pledge</strong>,&#8221; that contains a number of provisions &#8220;including not selling student information, not using online behavior to target advertising, using data for &#8221;authorized education purposes&#8220; only, agreeing to strict limits on retaining data, and giving parents access to information collected about their children.&#8221; Organizers of the pledge insist that <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2015/01/with_data-privacy_pledge_ed-tech_providers_also_face_legal_obligation.html">this is more than a pinky-swear</a>: &#8220;companies that sign could face government sanction if they are deemed to be deceiving consumers by going back on their word.&#8221;</p>

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation contributed a $4.5-million grant to Smart Sparrow for the project.&#8221; If you can&#8217;t make &#8217;em teach five classes for the price of four, replace &#8217;em with software, right?</p>
