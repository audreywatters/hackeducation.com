<h2>Obligatory MOOC News</h2>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong>, textbook publishers, and&nbsp;<strong>Chegg</strong>&nbsp;are teaming up to give students access to digital course materials for some Coursera classes. Those materials will be DRM&rsquo;d, content can&rsquo;t be copied, pasted, or printed, and access will go away at the end of the course.&nbsp;<a href="/2013/05/08/coursera-chegg/">Viva la ed-tech revolution</a>.</p>
<p>The union representing professors at <strong>San Jose State University</strong> (which has worked closely with both edX and Udacity) penned a letter regarding its administration&rsquo;s MOOC embrace. The full letter is available on&nbsp;<a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/139139/">The Chronicle</a>. Among the choice quotes: &ldquo;While Anant Agarwal of edX and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom describe a stereotype of classroom teaching based on some hackneyed Hollywood script of a teacher writing on the blackboard while his students sleep in boredom&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>San Francisco State University</strong>&rsquo;s Academic Senate also wrote a letter (<a href="https://sites7.sfsu.edu/senate/sites/sites7.sfsu.edu.senate/files/SB520%20_Hanley.pdf">PDF</a>) stating their opposition to State Senator Darrel Steinberg&rsquo;s SB 520 bill that would require credits be granted by online providers for &ldquo;closed&rdquo; classes. &ldquo;First [and let me interject and editorialize here&hellip; FIRST] there is no access crisis at San Francisco State University.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The administration at <strong>American University</strong> have issued a &ldquo;moratorium on MOOCs,&rdquo; according to&nbsp;<a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/139147/">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>. &ldquo;American is purposely avoiding experimentation before it decides exactly how it wants to relate to the new breed of online courses. &lsquo;I need a policy before we jump into something,&rsquo; said Scott A. Bass, the provost, in an interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong> is working on language for policy that would restrict what faculty could do vis-a-vis online freelance teaching work (aka non-sanctioned MOOCs, I guess). More details&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/08/u-pennsylvania-drafts-guidelines-keep-professors-competing-against-it-online">via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<h2>Testing Testing Testing</h2>
<p>The <strong>ACT</strong> will move towards computer-based testing,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/education/act-to-move-toward-computer-based-testing.html">says The New York Times</a>. &ldquo;High school students will take the ACT college admissions exam by computer starting in the spring of 2015 &mdash; but at least for a while, the paper and pencil version will be available, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are still more errors on New York City&rsquo;s Gifted and Talented screening test,&nbsp;<a href="http://gothamschools.org/2013/05/10/city-could-cancel-pearson-gt-contract-after-new-error-revealed/">report GothamSchools</a>. Last month, the city&rsquo;s Department of Education admitted that test-provider&nbsp;<strong>Pearson</strong> had made multiple errors, resulting in 5000-ish students getting lower scores than they deserved. Today&rsquo;s news adds another 300-ish students to that pile. This is Pearson&rsquo;s first year administering a $5.5 million contract for the screening program. Renewal will be a) unlikely b) ridiculous c) ludicrous d) all of the above.</p>
<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) has proposed a <a href="http://www.warren.senate.gov/documents/BankonStudentsFactSheet.pdf">bill</a> that would set the interest rate for federally subsidized <strong>student loans</strong> to .75%, the same rate as the Federal Reserve gives to banks.</p>
<p>ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/everything-we-know-about-whats-happened-under-sequestration#education">details some of the fallout</a> of the US government&rsquo;s <strong>sequestration</strong>, including the loss of 70,000 <strong>Head Start</strong> slots, major budgets cuts at schools on Indian reservations, and thousands of fewer NSF grants.</p>
<p>A group of young boys at Driver Elementary School in Virginia were <strong>suspended</strong> by district officials for pointing pencils at each other and making shooting noises. The district has a &ldquo;<strong>no tolerance</strong>&rdquo; policy for violence and &ldquo;there has to be a consequence,&rdquo; <a href="http://legalclips.nsba.org/?p=20222">said a district spokesperson</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Louisiana State Supreme Cour</strong>t ruled this week that the state&rsquo;s funding for its <strong>school voucher</strong> program is <a href="http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2013/05/breaking_louisiana_supreme_cou.html">unconstitutional</a>. The program was part of Governor Bobby Jindal&rsquo;s education reforms.</p>
<h2>Launches and Upgrades</h2>
<p>The University of Virginia&rsquo;s <strong>Scholars&rsquo; Lab</strong> <a href="https://www.scholarslab.org/digital-humanities/prism-for-play/">released</a> a new version of <strong>Prism</strong> this week, &ldquo;a web-based tool for &lsquo;crowdsourcing interpretation&rdquo; and a good reminder, I&rsquo;d add, for the school&rsquo;s Board of Visitors that if you get your news about UVA from David Brooks and not Bethany Nowviskie, then you have no idea what innovation looks like.</p>
<p>Educator and entrepreneur Adam Bellow had officially launched his site <strong><a href="http://educlipper.com/">Educlipper</a></strong>, which Free Technology for Teachers&rsquo; Richard Byrne <a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2013/05/educlipper-is-what-teachers-want.html">aptly describes</a> as &lsquo;What Teachers Want Pinterest to Be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the very best learning tools available, <strong><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a></strong>, invoked the 2.0 postscript this week, moving the learn-to-code software onto the Web. Finally. There are <a href="http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_2.0">lots of new features</a> in the updated release, including better ways to credit other users, easier cloning, and much more. Good job, Scratch Team.</p>
<p>The learning management system <strong>Desire2Learn</strong> <a href="http://desire2learn.com/products/learning-suite/">launched</a> a new &ldquo;Learning Suite&rdquo; this week that includes the &ldquo;power of predictive analytics.&rdquo; The company acquired Austin Peay State University&rsquo;s &ldquo;Degree Compass&rdquo; earlier this year, and it says that the course recommendation engine will be part of its new &ldquo;Student Success System.&rdquo; End press release speak.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/05/07/xerox-school-grades/2140749/">USA Today reports</a> that <strong>Xerox</strong> is getting into the grading papers business with a new product called Ignite &ldquo;that turns the numerous copiers/scanners/printers it has in schools across the United States into paper-grading machines.&rdquo; The article invokes the phrase &ldquo;game changer&rdquo; so there ya go.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/business/media/ted-partners-with-pbs-for-education-program.html">PBS aired a one-hour special of <strong>TED Talks</strong></a> on education this week, featuring Bill Gates. The Gates Foundation&rsquo;s list of grants awarded to PBS is <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database#q/k=pbs">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Downgrades and Closures</h2>
<p>More pushback against the Gates Foundation-funded data infrastructure <strong><a href="http://inbloom.org">inBloom</a></strong>? <a href="http://www.cherokeetribune.com/view/full_story/22473153/article-Ga--schools-superintendent-addresses-concerns-about-a-federal-curriculum">Speaking at a Republican Party breakfast</a>, Georgia Georgia Schools Superintendent John Barge said that &ldquo;while Georgia agreed to be part of the collaborative, it will not share the student data with InBloom. He also said while he&rsquo;s heard that InBloom staff have asked individual school systems to share the student data, the state will not be part of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And according to <a href="https://twitter.com/SSimonReuters/status/332524013526056960">Reuters journalist Stephanie Simon</a>, an <strong>inBloom</strong> spokesperson says that Phase II of the project is off; &ldquo;there are no plans&rdquo; to bring in Delaware, Georgia or Kentucky. And <a href="https://twitter.com/SSimonReuters/status/332525085539844096">she cites</a> Bob Swiggum, CIO for Georgia DOE, saying that &ldquo; furor over student privacy makes states wary of database: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how inBloom will survive this.&rsquo;&rdquo; $100 million well spent, Mr. Gates. Good job, team.</p>
<p><a href="http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-10/cengage-ceo-seeking-restructuring-may-file-bankrupy.html">Bloomberg reports</a> that textbook publisher <strong>Cengage Learning</strong> might file for bankruptcy. &ldquo;Cengage reported an operating loss of $2.77 billion for the three months ended March 3.&rdquo; But hey, at least it&rsquo;s partnered with Coursera to give MOOC students free textbooks, right?</p>
<h2>Funding and Acquisitions</h2>
<p>Okay, this isn&rsquo;t VC money. It&rsquo;s your tax dollars at work. But Deadspin asked a good question this week (and answered it in the headline too): &ldquo;<a href="http://deadspin.com/infographic-is-your-states-highest-paid-employee-a-co-489635228">Is Your State&rsquo;s Highest-Paid Employee a <strong>Coach</strong>? (Probably)</a>&rdquo; More details on salaries and funding of athletic versus instructional staff&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/08/coaching-salaries-rising-10-times-faster-instructional-salaries">via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p>The organization that I was fairly convinced for most of the week <em>had</em> to be a joke, Black Mountain SOLE, <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/education/sole/prweb10715093.htm">announced</a>&nbsp;that it&rsquo;s raised $5 million (although the press release doesn&rsquo;t say where the money actually came from.) So it's real. I guess. Black Mountain SOLE is responsible for <strong><a href="http://mooccampus.org/">MOOC Campus</a></strong>, a $15,000/year initiative that lets you live in a North Carolina YMCA while you take classes online. Because freedom. And disruptive innovation. And self directed learning. And rich white kids. And stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Fidelis</strong> announced that it has raised $6 million in its Series A round. The startup, at launch, focused on military personnel&rsquo;s transition into formal academic institutions, but the company has pivoted to a broader technology platform, still focused on mentorship.</p>
<p><strong>JoyTunes</strong>, an app-based music education startup, has raised $1.5 million in Series A funding, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/05/joytunes-lands-1-5m-releases-new-app-to-help-you-learn-to-play-instruments-through-interactive-mobile-games/">according to Techcrunch</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://vator.tv/news/2013-05-10-edtech-company-logical-choice-technologies-bags-5m">Vator News reports</a> that <strong>Logical Choice Technologies</strong>, a company founded in 1994, has raised $5 million in funding. Logical Choice Technologies is &ldquo;a technology solutions company for K12 and college that offers a wide range of products and services, from leading brands of mobile devices, projectors, and interactive whiteboards, to installation services and classroom curriculum&rdquo;&mdash; as well as augmented reality Common Core curriculum. Seriously.</p>
<p>Prague-based <strong>CourseDirector</strong>, which provides an LMS-like layer on top of Google Apps for Education, has been acquired by <strong>LingApps</strong>, a Danish ed-tech company (and maker of the assistive tech <a href="http://lingapps.com/appwriter">AppWriter</a>.</p>
<p>Interactive whiteboard maker <strong>Promethean World</strong> announced its first quarter results this week &mdash; &ldquo;in line with expectations&rdquo; <a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/business-news/promethean-world-results-line-expectations-3474775">reads the headline</a>, with revenues down 22.5% from &pound;35.9 million last quarter to &pound;27.8 million. &ldquo;Market conditions will continue to be challenging throughout 2013,&rdquo; said the company. Um, yeah.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Hispanic high school students are <a href="http://communitycollegespotlight.org/content/hispanic-grads-pass-whites-in-college-enrollment_13229/">more likely</a> than whites to enroll in college, according to the <strong>Pew Research Hispanic Center</strong>. 69% of Hispanic graduates from the class of 2012 and 67% of whites enrolled in college that fall. College graduation rates for Hispanics, however, remains lower.</p>
