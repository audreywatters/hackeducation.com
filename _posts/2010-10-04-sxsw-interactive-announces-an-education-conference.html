<p>One of the largest music festivals in the country that has quickly become one of the most popular technology events as well, <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">SXSW</a> announces today that this spring will mark the first "<a href="http://sxswedu.com">SXSWedu</a>," an interactive three-day event focused on Texas K-12 education.</p>
<p>The educational conference will be aimed at teachers and administrators and will spotlight Texas's new K-12 education professional development portal, <a href="http://projectsharetexas.org/">Project Share</a>.  The event will be facilitated by SXSW and the Texas Education Agency.</p>
<p>SXSWedu will take place March 8 - 10 -- immediately preceding this spring's SXSW in Austin.  Registration will be separate from SXSW Interactive, and will cost $175 through November, increasing incrementally to a $300 onsite registration fee.</p>
<p>The panels this year will not utilize SXSW's "<a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/">panel picker</a>" process due to time constraints, although the Festival Director Hugh Forrest <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/education/sxsw-interactive-launching-education-forum-951963.html">says</a> that some of the panels may be taken from those proposed for this spring's SXSW Interactive.  <a href="http://edupresent.sxsw.com/ideas/new">Panel submissions</a> are currently being accepted.</p>
