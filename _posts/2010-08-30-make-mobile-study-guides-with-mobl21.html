<p><a href="http://www.mobl21.com">Mobl21</a> is simple application that allows educators and students to create learning material that can then be made available in any mobile environment.  From personal study guides to formal courseware, the mobile learning platform is designed to make mobile content creation easier.</p>
<p>There are several pricing tiers, but at the free level, you can create a study guide, quizzes and flashcards that can be accessed via an iPhone or desktop.  Different price levels, including student and teacher packages, grant access to more quiz questions and more flashcards across more study categories.</p>
<p>The interface is fairly straight forward for those building the study guides.  And when appropriate, students can receive email notifications, informing them that content is ready for them to study.  Support for the Facebook platform, as well as other mobile devices, is in the works.</p>
