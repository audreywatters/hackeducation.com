<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Inspired by Stephen Downes'&nbsp;<a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2012/02/e-learning-generations.html">E-Learning Generations</a>&nbsp;and lots of thoughts about my own experiences with learning and technology&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="p1">I dropped out of college in the spring of 1991, just two years in to my undergraduate degree. &nbsp;My reasons were severalfold: &nbsp;I hated Johns Hopkins. &nbsp;I hated Baltimore. &nbsp;I was in love, and soon after dropping out, I was pregnant. &nbsp;Those are all stories for another day.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Shortly after the birth of my son, I realized that I had to go back to school and finish my degree. &nbsp;It was a realization that came, in part, from my utter boredom being at home with a baby. &nbsp;I read a lot of library books, sure, but I missed intellectual engagement with other adults. &nbsp;I'd say that was the impetus for my returning to college -- that, along with the recognition that as a young mom I'd "need" a degree more than ever in order to be considerate "legitimate." &nbsp;That and -- John Hopkins aside -- I'd always really liked school.</p>
<p class="p1">But after leaving Baltimore and after having a baby, I had returned to Casper, Wyoming -- my hometown and where my parents lived at the time. &nbsp;Wyoming only has one 4-year university in Laramie, Wyoming -- a 3.5 hour drive away. &nbsp;With or without a baby, commuting really wasn't an option. &nbsp;However, the local community college in Casper offered a Bachelors Degree through its extension service. &nbsp;It meant compromising on the degree I'd get as there were only a handful offered. &nbsp;As I'd been an International Relations and then a History major at Johns Hopkins, I had more credits towards a BS in Social Sciences than anything else. &nbsp;So that's what I figured I'd work towards.</p>
<p class="p1">It's not a particularly noble or intellectually inquisitive motivation for choosing a major, but there you go.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the problems with pursuing a degree through a local community college's extension service was that my options for onsite classes were severely limited. &nbsp;But it was also an incredible opportunity too as the program recognized that and encouraged me to find courses available elsewhere in order to fulfill my graduation requirements -- via "distance learning" (which at the time meant mostly correspondence courses or conference calls).</p>
<p class="p1">It was actually quite wonderful as the mom of a newborn, stuck in the middle of nowhere, motivated to finish her degree, that I could piece together a schedule that worked for me, particularly with classes that were offered asynchronously. I could weigh whether or not I wanted to take certain classes face-to-face or not.</p>
<p class="p1">As such, I purposefully took Intro to Statistics as a correspondence course. I'd heard that the local community college instructor wasn't so great, and so I signed up for a class through Colorado State University. I received in the mail a huge box of 20 videotapes, containing all the course lectures. &nbsp;That, along with the textbook, was all I had to help me through the various homework exercises and tests required. &nbsp;There was no opportunity or avenue for me to ask the professor questions. &nbsp;If I was confused -- and often I was -- the best I could do was rewind and replay the video in question. &nbsp;Over and over and over until things finally made sense (which was rarely) or until I opted to just haphazard a guess on the homework.</p>
<p class="p2">At the time, I was glad to have taken the class this way. &nbsp;Lectures on videotapes seemed preferable to lectures live. &nbsp;I could move through the content at my own pace. &nbsp;I didn't have to worry about the baby. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">But I struggled with the class, and it was the only B I got in college -- and if B really means "above average," I don't think I deserved that grade. &nbsp;I felt my understanding of statistics was fuzzy at best, although it was good enough to fulfill the prerequisites for the Intro to SPSS and Political Analysis class. &nbsp;I did take that class in a traditional classroom, I should note, and as I did so, it became a lot clearer why I needed to know certain basic statistical concepts. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">But my knowledge of statistics and statistical software packages has dwindled away to nothing nowadays. &nbsp;True, I haven't really been practicing or using either. &nbsp;But I have to wonder whether or not I ever had a strong conceptual grasp of the topic. &nbsp;Watching a series of video lectures served me well enough to complete class exercises and pass class exams. &nbsp;And for what it's worth, it was pretty helpful in my fulfilling various graduation requirements. &nbsp;But as far as what I learned and what I understood and what I retained, it wasn't so great.</p>
<p class="p2">No doubt, my experiences with this class and with other distance learning efforts colors how I think about online and blended learning today -- the opportunities and challenges and intellectual dead-ends alike.</p>
