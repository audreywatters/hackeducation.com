<p>The fourth book in my &#8220;Monsters of Education Technology&#8221; series is out. As with the other <a href="http://audreywatters.com/books/">books</a> in the series, it&#8217;s a collection of talks I&#8217;ve given through the course of the year.</p>

<p>E-book versions are available for purchase via the usual online retailers: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0771NM7R4">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/756386">Smashwords</a>. Even better (as far as my royalties go, at least): you can buy from me directly <a href="https://gumroad.com/products/jBVJX/">via Gumroad</a>. You can purchase the e-book there (a ZIP file that contains the MOBI, EPUB, and PDF versions) for $4.99. You can, of course, just read most of the content here on Hack Education for free.</p>

<p><em>The Monsters of Technology 4</em> likely the last book in the &#8220;Monsters&#8221; series, and as I&#8217;m switching my focus to finally finishing <em>Teaching Machines</em>, it&#8217;ll be my last book for a while. (I will try, however, to get print books and audio books of all four books in the series finalized &#8211; probably some time in mid&#8211;2018.)</p>
