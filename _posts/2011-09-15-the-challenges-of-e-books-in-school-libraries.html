<p>Just as many predicted, sales figures show that more people are opting to buy e-books rather than printed copies. Sales of e-books rose 167% in June, reports Publishers Weekly, with sales totaling $473.8 million for the first half of the year. But sales of print books � both paperbacks and hardcovers � continues to decline.</p>
<p>It isn't just publishers that are scrambling to adjust their business models to the growing demand for e-books; so too are libraries having to reconsider how they will provide content for their patrons.</p>

That's true for all libraries, but it's especially true for school libraries, many of which already face budget woes and as such, have to weigh carefully how to invest in new books to stock the shelves.</p>
