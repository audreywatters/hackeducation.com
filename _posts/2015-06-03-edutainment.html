<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/ed-tech-as-edutainment">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>Rolin Moe has followed up on my essay on the <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/05/30/the-learning-channel/">history of &ldquo;The Learning Channel&rdquo;</a> with a fabulous post on &ldquo;<a href="http://edutechnicalities.com/articles/the-golden-age-of-education-that-never-was/">The Golden Age of Education That Never Was</a>.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m grateful to Rolin for many of the resources that I used in my story, and I&rsquo;m thankful too that he&rsquo;s expanded on some of the ideas and offered further provocations.</p>

<p>Like Rolin, I am very interested in the connections &ndash; in form and content and, of course, ideology &ndash; between online educational content and some of the forms of media we have more traditionally believed were classroom-worthy &ndash; documentaries (most obviously) as well as &ldquo;newer forms&rdquo; like video games. I&rsquo;m interested too in the ways in which the definition of &ldquo;educational content&rdquo; has changed over time &ndash; not because I have nostalgic longings for the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; of filmstrips, nor solely because I see an encroachment of commercial interests into that very definition. I do think the technologies themselves have a role here: the rise of reality TV cannot be separated from increasing access to personal video recording technologies that have allowed us to, for example, submit our &ldquo;funniest home videos&rdquo; to TV networks as to YouTube. That has shaped what we think of as "documentary"; it has shaped, along with the Web, what we think of as authorship.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m four weeks into the edX MOOC &ldquo;<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/rise-superheroes-impact-pop-culture-smithsonianx-popx1-1x">The Rise of Superheroes and Their Impact On Pop Culture</a>.&rdquo; I spend a lot of time chuckling as I work my way through the weekly videos and readings, in no small part because Kevin Carey hung his argument about the &ldquo;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/03/26/technofantasies/">end of college</a>&rdquo; on the purported high quality of an edX course. This one I&rsquo;m currently taking &ndash; offered by the Smithsonian, I should note, not by MIT &ndash; is not a replacement for any college level course. Not by a long shot. It&rsquo;s enjoyable enough, I suppose &ndash; you get a look at the Smithsonian&rsquo;s comics collection, and there are lots of lengthy interviews with Stan Lee. (Stan Lee is the spitting image of my grandfather, and so I recognize that I have an amazingly high level of tolerance for the bullshit he spews.) The course is an homage to (mostly) Marvel Comics positioned in such a way as appeal to fans (confession: I spent the $150 for a verified certificate for this course because Stan Lee will sign it) and not so much to scholars or students. There is no critical analysis. Or very very little.</p>

<p>Lots of professors teach smart classes on comics and pop culture. Sorry, edX, this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be one of them.</p>

<p><em>This MOOC is edutainment</em>. And it&rsquo;s branded edutainment, not simply because Stan Lee is featured throughout, but because it never gets outside the mainstream comics industry. It feels fearful to challenge the major industry brands &ndash; perhaps Stan Lee wouldn&rsquo;t have participated? It feels fearful to push &ndash; perhaps because &ldquo;open education&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t figured out yet how it would deal with angry pop culture fans. It feels like a very comfortable story about the history of comics and their impact on pop culture &ndash; a story, dare I say, that would fit quite nicely on cable television.</p>
