<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 8 of my <a href="http://2012trends.hackeducation.com">Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2012</a> series</em></p>
<h3>An Introductory Sidenote</h3>
<br />
<p><em>In late 2007, Web browser pioneer, entrepreneur, and now venture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote a really great blog post about Internet platforms. When I decided I&rsquo;d write about education platforms as one of my Top Ed-Tech Trends, I immediately searched for it. I had only a vague recollection of what Andreessen had written. But I figured it&rsquo;d give a good definition of Internet platforms and be an interesting frame for what I wanted to say about the &ldquo;platforming of education." Because, ya know, it&rsquo;s Marc Andreessen. (Link to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Wikipedia entry</a>, in case you don&rsquo;t know.)&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>Slight problem: some time in 2009, Andreessen deleted most of his blog posts, including that one.</em></p>

<p><em>So a shout-out of thanks here to the folks who archived <a href="http://blog.jedchristiansen.com/2009/10/15/a-marc-andreessen-blog-archive/">much of</a> the site. And also, WTF Marc Andreessen deleting his blog?!</em></p>

<h3>Defining the Education Platform</h3>
<br />
<p>We throw the term &ldquo;platform&rdquo; around a lot in tech-speak, using it to refer to everything from software to hardware, from applications to operating systems, from websites to the Web and the Internet itself. In tech-marketing-speak, &ldquo;platform&rdquo; is often meant to invoke greatness or aspirations thereof: to become a platform is a goal &mdash; &ldquo;the next Facebook,&rdquo; if you will.</p>
<p>Marc Andreesen offered a good definition of platforms in a 2007 <a href="http://pmarca-archive.posterous.com/the-three-kinds-of-platforms-you-meet-on-the-0">post</a> titled &ldquo;The Three Kinds of Platforms You Meet on the Internet&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A &ldquo;platform&rdquo; is a system that can be programmed and therefore customized by outside developers &mdash; users &mdash; and in that way, adapted to countless needs and niches that the platform&rsquo;s original developers could not have possibly contemplated, much less had time to accommodate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andreessen goes on to argue that there are 3 levels of Internet platforms &mdash; 1. Access API, 2. Plug-in API, and 3. Runtime environment &mdash; the differences depending on where and how developers run the code, as well as the amount of technical expertise and financial resources necessary to do so. Level 3 platforms are the best for developers, Andreessen contends, adding that &ldquo;I believe that in the long run, all credible large-scale Internet companies will provide Level 3 platforms. Those that don&rsquo;t won&rsquo;t be competitive with those that do, because those that do will give their users the ability to so easily customize and program as to unleash supernovas of creativity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/ning150.jpg" alt="" align="right" />There are some flaws with Andreessen&rsquo;s taxonomy here (<a href="http://blogs.fluidinfo.com/terry/2007/10/26/andreessen-on-platforms/">best articulated by Fluidinfo&rsquo;s Terry Jones</a>) &mdash; least of which being his argument that <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a> (the company he was then chairman of) sits at the pinnacle of Level 3. But as we think about education platforms &mdash; who is building them, who is developing third-party apps for them, why, and how &mdash; I still think it&rsquo;s a useful technical framework.</p>
