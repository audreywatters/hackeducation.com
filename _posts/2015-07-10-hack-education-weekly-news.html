<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>The US House of Representatives <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/07/08/421225055/congress-considers-reauthorizing-no-child-left-behind-standards">voted</a> to reauthorize/rewrite No Child Left Behind.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/07/09/oregon-passes-free-community-college-bill-congressional-democrats-introduce-federal">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;Oregon now is poised to follow Tennessee as the second state with a plan on the books to provide free two-year college. And Democrats in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives introduced bills Wednesday that seek to make Obama's federal proposal a reality. The proposed legislation lacks any Republican support, however, so the bills are unlikely to go anywhere.&#8221; (More on the latter <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/231451/">in The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>.)</p>

<p>Democratic Presidential candidate and former Maryland Governor Martin O&#8217;Malley unveiled his plan for <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0715/morningeducation19049.html">debt-free college</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/231455/">Via The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>: &#8220;The average amount that college students spend on course materials appears to be declining. But not necessarily because textbooks are cheaper. A growing number of students, surveys show, simply skip buying required course materials.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Data, Privacy, and Surveillance</h3>
<br />
<p>A school district in Iowa will put body cameras on principals. &#8220;The district spent about $1,100 to purchase 13 cameras at about $85 each. They record with a date and time stamp, can be clipped onto ties or lanyards, and can be turned on and off as needed. For now, they won't be used to record all interactions with adults,&#8221; <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/07/keep-body-cameras-off-public-school-educators/398030/">says The Atlantic</a>.
