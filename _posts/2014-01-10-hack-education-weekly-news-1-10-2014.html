<h2>Brrrrrrrrrr!</h2>
<p><strong>Polar Vortex</strong>! Brutally cold weather across much of North America closed schools for several days this week. "Yay! Snow day!" cheered teachers and students. Others grumbled. Why?&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/01/school-wasnt-canceled-for-bad-weather-in-1882/282913/">According to The Atlantic</a>, school wasn&rsquo;t closed for bad weather during Laura Ingalls Wilder&rsquo;s life (circa 1880s), proving &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve all gone soft.&rdquo; Of course, she walked to school barefoot uphill both ways too.</p>
<h2>Education Politics and Policies</h2>
<p>Happy 12th birthday, <strong>No Child Left Behind</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">And many happy returns</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Obama Administration</strong> issued <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/index.html">guidelines</a> for <strong>student discipline</strong>, urging schools to use law enforcement as a &ldquo;last resort.&rdquo; The guidelines, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/us/us-criticizes-zero-tolerance-policies-in-schools.html">reports The New York Times</a>, are &ldquo;a response to a rise in zero-tolerance policies that have disproportionately increased the number of arrests, suspensions and expulsions of minority students for even minor, nonviolent offenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Maine</strong>&rsquo;s governor Paul LePage continues to be an utter embarrassment to the state, this week <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/politics/LePage_says_children_should_have_work_option.html">arguing</a> that <strong>child labor laws</strong> are detrimental to Maine&rsquo;s economy.

<p>The <strong>National Research Council</strong> has released a report on proposed changes to <strong>human subjects compliance</strong> regulations, suggesting there be a category of social science research that is &ldquo;excused.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/10/new-report-calls-reform-federal-rules-governing-human-subject-research">More details via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong> state will <a href="http://mobile.edweek.org/c.jsp?DISPATCHED=true&amp;cid=25983841&amp;item=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.edweek.org%2Fedweek%2Fmarketplacek12%2F2014%2F01%2Fnew_york_state_delays_uploading_private_student_data_to_cloud.html">delay</a> uploading student data into <strong>inBloom</strong>. The education department points to technical issues and says it&rsquo;s struggling to get the project off the ground, but the project is also facing legal challenges from parents opposed to it.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri</strong> millionaire Rex Sinquefield has <a href="http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/sinquefield-donates-750000-end-teacher-tenure">donated</a> $750,000 to help &ldquo;jumpstart the initiative petition drive for a ballot measure to end teacher tenure.&rdquo; The initiative would limit teacher contracts to no more than 3 years.</p>

<p>Six educators <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/education/test-scandal-in-atlanta-brings-more-guilty-pleas.html">pleaded guilty</a> to charges relating to their role in the <strong>Atlanta Public Schools</strong> cheating scandal.</p>
<h2>1:1 Initiatives</h2>
<p>The <strong>LAUSD</strong> iPad saga continues! <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2014/01/07/15541/report-la-schools-wifi-networks-may-not-be-ready-f/">According to KPCC</a>, &ldquo;only 208 of the district&rsquo;s 800 schools have the network capacity to support every student and teacher having an <strong>iPad</strong>.&rdquo; A great example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Ps_(military_adage)">7 Ps</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Baltimore</strong> is preparing to go 1:1 with ten &ldquo;Lighthouse&rdquo; elementary schools. <a href="http://www.bcps.org/news/articles/article4477.html">According to the district press release</a>, &ldquo;The 10 schools will be the first in the school system to receive individual digital learning devices for students; implement one-to-one personalized and blended learning; and create an innovative, comprehensive digital learning culture.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>MOOCs</h2>
<p>&ldquo;MOOCs ain&rsquo;t over,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.christenseninstitute.org/moocs-aint-over/">insists</a> the <strong>Clayton Christensen Institute</strong>. Cute, as there wasn&rsquo;t any other MOOC news this week.</p>

Hmm. (I remember tweeting two years ago at an Apple press event that iTunes U might mark the death of the LMS. But Apple has been pretty quiet on this front, even with all the MOOC hoopla. Apple didn&rsquo;t comment on this story either, despite &ndash; ya know &ndash; education being <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/141287/phil-schiller-education-is-in-apples-dna-apple-education-event/">part of its DNA</a>.)</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/heres-exactly-how-much-the-government-would-have-to-spend-to-make-public-college-tuition-free/282803/">Here&rsquo;s Exactly How Much the Government Would Have to Spend to Make Public College <strong>Tuition-Free</strong></a>&rdquo;: $62.6 billion dollars.</p>
