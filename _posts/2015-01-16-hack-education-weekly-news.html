<h3>ESEA Reauthorization?</h3>
<br />
<p>Senator <strong>Lamar Alexander</strong> has released a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/reviewing-federal-education-law-senator-seeks-more-local-control.html">draft of his bill</a> to overhaul the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, better known by the name of its latest version: <strong>No Child Left Behind</strong>. According to The New York Times, the bill offers &#8220;two options: one that would retain the mandate of <strong>annual testing</strong> and one that would give states the freedom to choose between annual testing or testing once every three years.&#8221; </p>
