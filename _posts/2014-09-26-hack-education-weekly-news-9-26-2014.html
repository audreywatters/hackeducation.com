<h2>MOOCs Insist "We're Not Dead Yet!"</h2>
<p>The Techcrunch headline: &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/24/its-audacity-undiminished-udacity-raises-35-million-to-train-a-new-generation-of-developers/">Its Audacity Undiminished, <strong>Udacity</strong> Raises $35 Million To Train A New Generation of Developers</a>.&rdquo; The new round of funding is from &ldquo;the German media giant Bertelsmann, Japanese staffing company Recruit, Brazilian investment firm Valor Capital Group, and American cable and media company Cox Enterprises, also joined as new investors. Previous backers Andreessen Horowitz, Charles River Ventures, Peter Levine, and George Zachary also participated in the financing.&rdquo; The startup has now <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/udacity">raised</a> at least $55 million. Founder Sebastian Thrun has quit his job at <strong>Google X</strong>, prompting a question typed, I presume, with a serious face: &ldquo;<a href="http://upstart.bizjournals.com/entrepreneurs/hot-shots/2014/09/24/can-google-x-s-recently-departed-founder-save-the.html?page=all">Can Google X&rsquo;s recently departed founder save the MOOC?</a>&rdquo;</p>
