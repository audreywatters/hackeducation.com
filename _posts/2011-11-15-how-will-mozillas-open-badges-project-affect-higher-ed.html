<p>Yesterday marked the deadline for the first round of submissions for the 2011<a href="http://www.dmlcompetition.net/">Digital Media and Learning Competition</a>. This year's topic: designing badges (and the supporting research) for lifelong learning.</p>

The<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges">Open Badges Project</a>is working to create an alternative -- and accepted -- form of certification that combines merit-earned badges with an open infrastructure framework.
