<p>About a month ago, I decided I'd had my fill of the Silicon Valley tech blogs. &nbsp;I can't even remember now what triggered it -- a thousand different blog posts, all restating the same thing about the latest iPad probably. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So I&nbsp;unsubscribed&nbsp;to all the tech blogs in my feeds. &nbsp;Techcrunch. The Next Web. &nbsp;GigaOm. &nbsp;ReadWriteWeb. &nbsp;The Verge. Pando Daily. Unsubscribed to the lot of them (save O'Reilly Radar, admittedly, as I do freelance there).</p>
<p>I still follow a Twitter list of tech publications. &nbsp;I read The New York Times' tech section. &nbsp;I read The Atlantic's. &nbsp;I even get Techmeme's Tweets pushed to my iPhone (thanks&nbsp;<a href="http://boxcar.io/">Boxcar</a>!), giving me the major tech headlines of the day in close-to-real-time. &nbsp;What else do I need to know?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is "everything." I am a tech writer after all, and even if my primary focus is ed-tech&nbsp;I thought for a long time that I had to know the major trends, the major players, the major entrepreneurs, the major investors.</p>
<p>But wading through all the tech blogs wasn't worth my time. I could know all those things without reading them. &nbsp;And I figure that ed-tech's what matters most to me, not the tiny details of the tech industry at large. &nbsp;And I have my own ways of keeping up with ed-tech that don't involve reading news about it in the "mainstream" (or Silicon Valley) tech blogs. &nbsp;I use Twitter extensively. &nbsp;I still read specifically ed-tech focused publications. &nbsp;I read educators' blogs. &nbsp;I have multiple Google Alerts.</p>
<p>And so over the past month, what have I missed?</p>
<p>In a nutshell: &nbsp;nothing.</p>
<p>I haven't missed anything important. I haven't missed the tech blogs at all.</p>
<p>There's so much repetition and posturing in the tech blogs. One news item, one update, launch, press release, funding announcement -- it appears in multiple iterations across them all. &nbsp;Every news item, every feature update, every upgrade, every personnel change, and oh let's not forget every little piece of Silicon Valley drama.</p>
<p>I'm done with wading through it all, hoping to find something about education technology. &nbsp;And so "unsubscribe." "Unsubscribe." &nbsp;"Unsubscribe."</p>
<p>I rely instead on others, on curation&nbsp;-- on those I follow on Twitter, and on Techmeme. &nbsp;It's given me pause in thinking about the future of RSS, of course, although I do still have a Google Reader chock full of subscriptions.</p>
<p>So in the past month, have I missed any ed-tech news? &nbsp;Maybe. &nbsp;But if so, it's because no teachers I follow on Twitter tweeted about it. &nbsp;It triggered no Google Alerts. &nbsp;Nobody said "Hey, check this out!" &nbsp;And so I didn't.</p>
<p>And wow, I am so much happier for it. &nbsp;Strangely enough now, I think I'm reading more too -- just not so much dross.</p>
