<p>Congratulations to the <strong>European Science Agency</strong>, which this week landed the Philae spacecraft on a comet &ndash; the first such landing in history. Amazing. But a big thumbs-down to the agency and particularly to Rosetta Project scientist Matt Taylor for the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/13/why-women-in-science-are-annoyed-at-rosetta-mission-scientists-clothing">sexist shirt</a> he wore for the occasion. And gee, we wonder why women and girls feel unwelcome in science and technology. These sorts of <strong>microaggressions</strong> are pervasive &ndash; in the clothing and in comments like this from from Taylor, describing the landing: "the sexiest mission there&rsquo;s ever been. She&rsquo;s sexy, but I never said she was easy.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/11/sesame-street-has-aimed-too-low-and-will-probably-be-a-disappointment/382579/">Happy 45th birthday</a> to <strong>Sesame Street</strong>. Thank you for everything.</p>
<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>

<p><a href="http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/IndyBlog/archives/2014/11/11/student-sues-um-over-alleged-privacy-rights-violations">Via the Missoula Independent</a>: &ldquo;<strong>University of Montana</strong> law student Daniel Knudsen filed suit against UM this week over alleged <strong>violations of privacy rights</strong>. Knudsen&rsquo;s complaint, filed on behalf of all students enrolled at UM from spring 2010 to the present, claims the university illegally released his and others&rsquo; personally identifiable information to Connecticut-based Higher One Holdings, a vendor that handles UM&rsquo;s electronic refunds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a hearing in <strong>Philadelphia</strong> over whether to revoke the charter for the Walter Palmer charter school, officials <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/education/20141112_almer_school_officials_cited_Fifth_Amendment_in_charter_revocation_hearing_-_77_times.html">invoked</a> the Fifth Amendment 77 times.</p>

<h2>Students Loans and Student Debt</h2>
<p><strong>Student debt</strong> is up 2% from last year, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/11/13/average-student-debt-across-country-again-ticked-2013-new-report-says">according to a report from the Institute for College Access and Success</a>.

<p><a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/grad-students-carry-40-percent-all-student-debt-180953288/?no-ist"><strong>Graduate students&rsquo; debt</strong></a> makes up 40% of all student loan debt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the end of the line for the <strong>Perkins Loan Program</strong>?&rdquo; <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/150045/">asks The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>. [Cue ominous music.] There&rsquo;s talk the new Republican-led Congress wants to simply the federal loan program, down from six to three programs &ndash; one for undergrads, one for graduate students, and one for parents.</p>
<h2>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h2>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> announced that it has struck a deal with the <strong>Department of Veterans Affairs</strong>, making one free verified certificate available to each US veteran. According to <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/102287882992/michelle-obama-announces-free-coursera-credentials-and">Coursera</a>, &ldquo;this effort will expose Veteran learners to industry relevant education and help them master new skills to succeed in today&rsquo;s workforce.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s <em>fascinating</em> how the Obama Administration says it wants to crack down on for-profit universities, and then happily funnels money to another for-profit higher ed company. <a href="http://tressiemc.com/2014/11/10/ask-not-what-your-country-can-do-for-you-but-what-coursera-can-do-for-your-country-part-1/">Tressie McMillan Cottom responds</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/11/10/columbia-launches-hybrid-learning-initiative.aspx">Via Campus Technology</a>: &ldquo;<strong>Columbia University</strong> has launched an initiative to turn more of its traditional lecture courses into hybrid learning experiences that would incorporate the use of audiovisual materials, social media, flipped classrooms and real-time feedback from students.&rdquo; My guess, the project will not be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fathom.com">Fathom</a>. Might I suggest &ldquo;Blended Fathom&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Florida</strong>&rsquo;s new online university, UF Online, will not offer a political science degree after the department voted against it.

<p>Muslims in <strong>Montgomery County, Maryland</strong> asked the district to close schools on their two most important religious holidays &ndash; ya know, like schools do for Christian and Jewish holy days. &ldquo;Instead, the school board voted 7&ndash;1 on Tuesday to strip all mention of religious holidays from the calendar, even though Christian and Jewish holidays remain official days off,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/11/12/7205457/montgomery-county-muslim-holidays">reports Libby Nelson for Vox</a>.</p>
