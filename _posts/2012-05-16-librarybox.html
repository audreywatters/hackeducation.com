<p>Inside NYU art professor David Darts&rsquo; black metal lunchbox, painted with a white skull and crossbones, is the <a href="http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox">PirateBox</a> &ndash; a tiny Linux server, a wireless router, and a battery. Turn the PirateBox on and you have a self-contained mobile communications and file-sharing device, whereby those in the vicinity can upload and download files securely and anonymously. (See this 2011&nbsp;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/01/piratebox-an-artistic-provocation-in-lunchbox-form/">Ars Technica</a> story for photos and details.) Built with free and open source software and <a href="http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en">openly licensed</a> itself, the PirateBox has inspired a number of other projects, including <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/storybox/">Alan Levine&rsquo;s Storybox</a> and now Jason Griffey&rsquo;s <a href="http://jasongriffey.net/librarybox">LibraryBox</a>.</p>

<p>The head of Library Information Technology at the University of Tenneessee at Chattanooga, Griffey has built a prototype of the LibraryBox, whose &ldquo;guts&rdquo; sit nestled in a carved-out book rather than in a lunchbox, and he&rsquo;s <a href="http://jasongriffey.net/wp/2012/05/11/librarybox-a-call-for-help/">looking for help</a> in customizing the device to better suit the needs of a mobile DIY library.</p>
<p>As with its lunchbox ancestors, the LibraryBox generates a wireless network that anyone can join via a WiFi-enabled device. That network isn&rsquo;t connected to the larger Internet, just to the box itself. But from there, people can access the contents of its file server &ndash; and they can do so anonymously as no data is tracked or stored on who they are or what they download. There's also no need for specific e-reader hardware or apps, as even the cheapest of cellphones tend to have WiFi, and e-books can be downloaded and opened in several formats (including HTML, ePUB, PDF, and QiOO Mobile).</p>
<p>Griffey <a href="http://jasongriffey.net/wp/2012/04/03/librarybox/">says</a> the LibraryBox will &ldquo;take the 'pirate' out of PirateBox.&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t mean exorcising the spirit of the larger PirateBox project, which its creator Darts says was &ldquo;inspired by the free culture and pirate radio movements&rdquo; and serves as a &ldquo;playful remixing of the title of the world&rsquo;s most resilient bittorrent site, <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">The Pirate Bay</a>.&rdquo; Rather, replacing &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; with &ldquo;library&rdquo; makes it more apparent, in Griffey&rsquo;s case, that this is about open access to information and to books. As he describes some of the <a href="http://jasongriffey.net/wp/2012/05/11/librarybox-a-call-for-help/">inquiries he&rsquo;s received</a> about the LibraryBox, it&rsquo;s clear that this device could have enormous potential for boosting literacy and education and for opening access to digital educational materials.</p>
<p>Griffey says he has lots of plans for LibraryBox that will make it a true fork of the PirateBox project (making it easier to install for those folks unfamiliar with the Linux command line, for starters). He&rsquo;s also pursuing a way to scrape&nbsp;<a href="/admin/blog/gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a> for public domain content. <a href="http://jasongriffey.net/wp/contact-me/">Drop him a line to help out</a>.</p>
