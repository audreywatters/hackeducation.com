<p>Citing the move to more and more online instruction, <a href="http://www.cisco.com">Cisco</a> has just announced its <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/virtual_classroom/syllabus">Virtual Classroom Instruction Specialist</a> certification, a program that's designed to help build educators' skills so they can effectively teach in virtual classroom environments.</p>
<p>It's not cheap.  The training will cost you $1395, and the certification exam will set you back another $150.</p>
<p>For that price, you'll get what Cisco says is a vender-neutral training (although one that's delivered via the company's WebEx platform, of course).  The training consists of 17.5 hours of live virtual instruction and 6 hours of participant presentations, running over the course of 5 consecutive days.</p>
<p>Cisco says the course teaches participants how to prepare and manage a virtual classroom, effectively deliver material online, and use collaboration tools to maximize student participation and comprehension.</p>
