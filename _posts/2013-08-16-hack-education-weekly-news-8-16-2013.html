<h2>The (Federal, State, and City) Politics of Education</h2>
<p><strong>Philadelphia School District</strong> officials say that schools in the city will open on time now that the city has promised to come up with the $50 million the district says it needs.

<h2>Accreditation</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>City College of San Francisco</strong>&rsquo;s regional accreditor is now in the same existential bind as the college, having been told by its overseer to fix several problems, pronto, or risk being stripped of power,&rdquo; writes <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/08/14/education-department-reprimands-accreditor-san-franciscos-community-college">Inside Higher Ed&rsquo;s Paul Fain</a>.

<p>Good thing we don&rsquo;t make any life or death decisions on these sorts of things, right? Oh wait...</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong> teen Anthony Stokes was initially denied a place on the heart transplant list Children&rsquo;s Healthcare of Atlanta &ldquo;partly because of his history of low grades and trouble with the law.&rdquo; As news of the story spread, the hospital <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/08/14/2464751/anthony-heart-transplant-list/">said</a> it had changed his mind and had added Stokes to the transplant list.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>

About one third of charters, <a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-655R">according to the GAO</a>, do not indicate how many ELL students they enroll. It has recommended that the DOE explore if there are other gaps in the charters&rsquo; data reporting.</p>
<p>The Pew Internet and American Life Project released a report this week on <strong>teens and online privacy</strong>. (<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2013/PIP_TeensandPrivacyAdvice.pdf">PDF</a>) It finds that teens rely on one another for privacy advice; just 9% turn to a teacher. Librarians weren&rsquo;t even mentioned. Hmmm. What does this say about how schools are (or aren&rsquo;t) helping students understand their digital identities?</p>

Takacs and <strong>Hamilton College</strong> professor Daniel F. Chambliss, &ldquo;Undergraduates are significantly more likely to major in a field if they have an inspiring and caring faculty member in their introduction to the field. And they are equally likely to write off a field based on a single negative experience with a professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teachers are known to spend a lot of their own money on classroom supplies, but <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/23/more-than-half-of-teacher_n_368356.html">according to a report by Share Our Strength</a>, 63% of teachers report buying <strong>food</strong> for their classroom to help feed hungry students.</p>
