<p>The <strong>2011 Horizon Report</strong> (<a href="http://www.nmc.org/pdf/2011-Horizon-Report.pdf">PDF</a>) was released today.  The annual report, a collaborative publication undertaken by the New Media Consortium and EDUCASE, assesses the emerging technology trends that will shape the next ten years of teaching and learning.</p>
<p>This year, the report lists the following trends as up-and-coming:</p>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
2011
</ul>
</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One Year or Less</td>
<td>Mobile Computing E-Books</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Two to Three Years</td>
<td>Augmented Reality Game-Based Learning</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Four to Five Years</td>
<td>Gesture-Based Computing Learning Analytics</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The short-term trends here feel right to me, but I'm not sure, even with those, that we can gauge much.  The prediction game, after all, is a difficult one.</p>
<p>For the sake of comparison, here are the trends that were listed in the 2009 and 2010 reports:</p>
<table width="95%" align="center">

<tr>

<ul class="mainlist">

<td width="35%"><strong></strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
<strong>2009</strong>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One Year or Less</td>
<td>Mobile Computing  Open Content</td>
<td>Mobile Computing Cloud Computing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Two to Three Years</td>
<td>Augmented Reality E-Books</td>
<td>Geo-Everything the Personal Web</td>

<p>I don't post these older predictions here so as to dismiss the Horizon Report.  In fact, I think the year-to-year comparisons are just as interesting as a single year's report.  This way, you can see how the Horizon Report has reassessed its predictions -- what's changed and what's stayed the same, what's been bumped up and what's been bumped off the list.  All in the service of answering "why?" -- has the technology been embraced or abandoned?</p>
<p>Mobile, for example, has been in the year-or-less spot for the past two-to-three.  As my ReadWriteWeb colleague Sarah Perez noted today, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/smartphones_outsell_pcs.php">smartphones outsold PCs</a> worldwide for the first time ever during the first quarter of 2010.  Clearly consumers have embraced mobile technologies in a big big way. So is this adoption (still) less than a year away in educational settings?  Or, despite the ubiquity of mobile outside of the classroom, do major obstacles (<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/02/07/will-the-state-of-georgia-really-replace-textbooks-with-ipads">infrastructure</a>, <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/02/05/pbs_survey">perceptions</a>, budget) persist that stop us from bringing mobile tools into the classroom?</p>
<p>E-readers, it's worth noting, did move up the list -- the only technology trend from previous years that has made progress, if you will.  But gone from last year, I couldn't help but notice, open educational resources -- a trend I think (I hope) is still very important.  Has it been adopted and so isn't on the horizon/in the report?  I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts of this year's Horizon Report?  Do you agree with this list of emerging tech trends?</p>
