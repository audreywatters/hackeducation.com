<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This post first appeared on <a href="http://modernlearners.com/rethinking-assessment-pearson-and-efficacy/">Educating Modern Learners</a></em></p>
<p>Late last year, Pearson <a href="http://www.pearson.com/news/2013/november/pearson-commits-tomeasureandreportimpactonlearningoutcomes.html">announced</a>&nbsp;that  it would make "a series of unique commitments designed to measure and  increase the company's impact on learning outcomes around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pearson  is, of course, the world's largest education company, with holdings  across the publishing, school services, and assessments industries. (To  see a visualization of Pearson&rsquo;s reach, <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/gb/00872828/network">click on the &ldquo;show as network&rdquo; button to update the graph</a>.)  So its decision to commit to measuring and increasing &ldquo;learning  outcomes&rdquo; is significant and will undoubtedly shape the larger education  sector.</p>
<p>Pearson's announcement shouldn&rsquo;t be dismissed outright as simply a matter of rebranding either. Indeed, education consultant <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/can-pearson-solve-rubrics-cube/">Michael Feldstein</a>&nbsp;has  described Pearson&rsquo;s new focus as "a remarkably detailed blueprint of  how they intend to rebuild their machine from the ground up."</p>
<p>Pearson calls this commitment to measuring learning outcomes &ldquo;<a href="http://efficacy.pearson.com/">efficacy</a>,&rdquo;  a term it admits it has borrowed from the pharmaceutical industry &mdash; an  attempt to echo the processes and the research that go into medical  trials before, during, and after products are brought to market. (It is  an interesting way to frame Pearson products, no doubt &mdash; textbooks and  assessments are prescribed to students by knowledgable, licensed  professionals. It certainly views the process of education as a clinical  endeavor.)</p>
<h2>How Does Pearson Define &ldquo;Efficacy&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>Pearson&rsquo;s  definition of &ldquo;efficacy": &ldquo;an education product has efficacy if it has  'a measurable impact on improving people&rsquo;s lives through learning."  (More on this in its &ldquo;<a href="http://efficacy.pearson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The-Incomplete-Guide-to-Delivering-Learning-Outcomes-high-res1.pdf%29">Incomplete Guide to Delivering Learning Outcomes</a>&rdquo;)&nbsp;To that end, Pearson has created an &ldquo;efficacy framework tool," a workbook you can complete <a href="http://efficacy.pearson.com/efficacy-tool/">online</a>&nbsp;or offline (<a href="http://efficacy.pearson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Efficacy-Framework-tool-workbook-high-res.pdf.pdf">PDF</a>), to "help you to explore what efficacy means and identify any barriers to delivering desired learner outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pearson&rsquo;s  efficacy framework contains four areas: outcomes, evidence,  planning/implementation, and capacity to deliver. It asks those  reviewing products and services many questions along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you identified specific outcomes for your target group?</li>
<li>Do you have a way to measure the intended outcomes?</li>
<li>Do you have ambitious and measurable targets in place, and deadlines for achieving them?</li>
<li>Are your intended outcomes clearly documented and understood by the relevant people within and outside your organization?</li>
<li>Is the product designed in a way that will most effectively help your target group to&nbsp;reach their goals?</li>
<li>Do you understand the benefits of your product or service to your target group, relative to other options?</li>
<li>Is the cost of the product/service competitive, considering the benefits it&nbsp;would&nbsp;deliver?</li>
<li>Do you collect evidence using a range of methods (quantitative, qualitative, internal&nbsp;and external for example)?</li>
<li>Do you have evidence from all users of your product/service?</li>
<li>Does the evidence you have collected link directly to what you are trying to achieve?</li>
<li>Is  the evidence you have collected unbiased? Applicable to your  product/service? Recent? And does it measure success over a period of  time?</li>
<li>Is the evidence you have collected relevant, representative and where possible at an&nbsp;individual level?</li>
<li>Do  you have a plan in place to achieve your outcomes, including  milestones, actions, responsibilities and timelines? Is it easy to  access and update?</li>
<li>Does your plan include short- and long-term priorities?</li>
<li>Have you identified any potential risks and included actions to mitigate these in your plan?</li>
<li>Do people within and outside your organisation understand who is responsible for decision-making regarding your product/service?</li>
<li>Do you get/have access to real-time feedback from your users?</li>
<li>Does  your organisation have the right number of people, and people with the  right skills to enable you to deliver your desired outcomes?</li>
<li>Does your organisation have a culture focused on delivering outcomes, and is it collaborative and innovative?</li>
<li>Does your organisation have enough budget to support this?</li>
<li>Do leaders within your organisation support your work and are there opportunities to work with others across the organization?</li>
<li>Have you put measures in place to build users&rsquo; skills?</li>
<li>Is there a culture of partnership and collaboration between your organization and&nbsp;your stakeholders?</li>
</ul>
<p>There's nothing wrong with any of these questions But as a  framework designed to re-align the company's products and services with  better learning outcomes I&rsquo;m not sure that they&rsquo;re sufficient to  provide any major changes in how things are developed or implemented. It  seems unlikely that running through these questions will lead to the  sort of transformation that Michael Feldstein argues Pearson is after.  Feldstein suggests that, despite using words like &ldquo;stakeholders,&rdquo; that  Pearson is very much focused here on an <em>internal </em>culture&nbsp;change, a  way to stay relevant (and profitable) as the traditional textbook  industry is reshaped, even threatened by digital technologies.</p>
<h2>Is &ldquo;Efficacy&rdquo; The Right Framework for Education?</h2>
<p>But  it&rsquo;s fair to ask, of course, if Pearson&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;efficacy&rdquo; is  likely to match those of schools, scholars, parents, communities, and  students. Are the priorities the same? Is &ldquo;efficacy&rdquo; even the right  word? The right goal? Is focusing on &ldquo;measurable outcomes&rdquo; the right  approach? Feldstein adds,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are potentially  conflicting criteria. The framework itself provides nothing to help  resolve this tension. At best, it potentially scaffolds a norming  conversation. But a product management methodology that can combine  knowledge about efficacy, user desires, and usability requires more  tools than that. And that problem is even worse in some ways now that  product teams have multiple specialized roles. The editor, author,  adopting teacher, instructional designer, cognitive science researcher,  psychometrician, data scientist, and UX engineer may all work together  to develop a unified vision for a product, but more often than not they  are like the blind man and the elephant. Agreeing in principle on what  attributes an effective product might have is not at all the same as  being able to design a product to be effective, where &ldquo;effective&rdquo; is  shared notion between the company and the customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Wait. What Do We Mean By &ldquo;Learning Outcomes"?</h2>
<p>Although it remains an education juggernaut, Pearson&rsquo;s  core textbook business is hardly thriving. (No major textbooks  publisher&rsquo;s business is, truth be told.) And as Feldstein notes in his  analysis of Pearson&rsquo;s new efficacy push, one of the strategies that many  publishers are toying with involves a focus on analytics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Textbook  publishers have noticed that products that have the word &ldquo;analytics&rdquo; or  &ldquo;adaptive learning&rdquo; associated with them sell well. There is still a  lot of whiz-bangery to the industry&rsquo;s thinking, but it is starting to  dawn on them that their products might sell better if they can prove  that those products actually&hellip;you know&hellip;work. If they do work. If they  provably help people to learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pearson is <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/knewton">a major investor in Knewton</a>,  a company that takes textbook and course materials and delivers them in  an order algorithmically "adapted" to students&rsquo; learning profiles. Both  adaptive learning and this push for &ldquo;efficacy&rdquo; tie neatly into a larger  reframing of education &mdash; as an efficiently designed pathway through  pre-determined learning objectives, enhanced and measured by  technologies.</p>
<p>Of course we want our learning to be "effective."  But the fixation on measurement and efficiency remains unsettling.  Thankfully (for my own thinking at least) Virginia Commonwealth  University Vice Provost Gardner Campbell recently wrote a blog post on &ldquo;<a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=2239">Understanding and learning outcomes</a>&rdquo;&nbsp;that  does much to question some of the very premises that the new Pearson  framework, along with the broader push for more data collection and  analysis, is built upon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we seek to perfect the  language and institutionalization of a culture of &ldquo;learning outcomes,&rdquo;  it seems we are necessarily moving toward a strictly behaviorist  paradigm of learning, away from what Jerome Bruner refers to as the  &ldquo;cognitive turn&rdquo; in learning theory and ever more deliberately toward a  stimulus-response paradigm of learning. This behaviorist turn can be  very sophisticated and refined. The behaviors specified, measured, and  tracked can be cognitively demanding &ldquo;smart human tricks.&rdquo; There can  even be qualitatively measured learning outcomes, though it appears  these are less frequent than quantitative metrics, for reasons I think  are obvious. Yet these are still behaviors, specified with a set of what  I can only describe as jawohl! statements, all rewarding the bon eleves  and marching toward compliance and away from more elusive and  disruptive concepts like curiosity or wonder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Teaching  and learning are difficult, sometimes bewildering activities, and it&rsquo;s  natural to want to have clarity about it all. It&rsquo;s also natural, and to  some extent a good thing too, when we seek accountability for our  professional activities. Asking &ldquo;what do we want to happen, and how will  we know if we get there?&rdquo; is an entirely fair and just thing to do.  It&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;re forbidden to use &ldquo;mushy&rdquo; words like &ldquo;understand&rdquo; and  &ldquo;appreciate&rdquo; because &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t be measured&rdquo; that the trouble begins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How different Campbell&rsquo;s vision is from that of <a href="http://efficacy.pearson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Asking-More-The-Path-to-Efficacy-high-res1.pdf">Pearson CEO John Fallon</a>, who writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It  is increasingly possible to determine what works and what doesn&rsquo;t in  education, just as in healthcare. The elements of learning can be mapped  out, the variables isolated and a measurable impact on learning  predicted and delivered. This can be done at every level &ndash; a single  lesson, a single individual, a classroom, an institution or a whole  system. It can also be done for a product or service that&rsquo;s designed to  help people learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Campbell suggests that "One metric  for that generative outcome might be called &lsquo;civilization.' The best  kinds of generative outcomes might be called &lsquo;wisdom.&rsquo;&rdquo; Is the latter an  outcome Pearson, or any textbook publisher for that matter, can ever  provide?</p>
