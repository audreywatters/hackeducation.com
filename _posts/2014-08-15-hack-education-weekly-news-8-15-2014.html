<p><a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174742">RIP <strong>Robin Williams</strong></a> and <a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-20/">RIP <strong>Michael Brown</strong></a> &ndash; my god, this week has been so painful.</p>
<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Education Department</strong> <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-awards-40-states-dc-and-virgin-islands-284-million-grants-h">Awards</a> 40 States, D.C., and the Virgin Islands $28.4 Million in Grants to Help Low-Income Students Take <strong>Advanced Placement Tests</strong>&rdquo; &ndash; so congrats to the <strong>College Board</strong> that will profit handily (wink wink) from this boost.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <strong>Republican National Committee</strong> has <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/rnc-ap-exam-revisionist-history">denounced</a> the the <strong>College Board</strong> for new frameworks it has issued for the <strong>AP US History exam</strong>, claiming it promotes a "radically revisionist view of American history that emphasizes negative aspects of our nation&rsquo;s history while omitting or minimizing positive aspects."</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/atlanta-jury-selection-set-to-begin-school-employees-accused-of-altering-test-scores.html">trial</a> of 12 former <strong>Atlanta</strong> Public School employees, accused of conspiring to alter students&rsquo; test scores, started this week.</p>
<p>Also heading to the courts: several <a href="http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2014/08/common_core_dispute_between_ji.html">lawsuits</a> in <strong>Louisiana</strong> over the state&rsquo;s adoption (or not) of the <strong>Common Core</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>New Jersey</strong> high school student has <a href="http://www.nj.com/camden/index.ssf/2014/08/nj_school_district_to_pay_students_legal_fees_amend_social_media_policy_after_lawsuit_over_tweet.html">settled</a> a lawsuit with her school district, after she said she was punished for a couple of profane tweets about her principal. The district has reversed its punishments of her and expunged her record. It will also clarify its <strong>social media policy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong> has published a &ldquo;parents&rsquo; bill of rights&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.p12.nysed.gov/docs/parents-bill-of-rights.pdf">PDF</a>) to address how <strong>student data</strong> can be used.</p>
<p>The Cape Henlopen School Board in <strong>Delaware</strong> has <a href="http://cbldf.org/2014/07/cape-henlopen-board-eliminates-entire-reading-list-in-dispute-over-cameron-post/">scrapped</a> its summer reading list for incoming high school students. Originally the board chose to remove from the list <em>The Miseducation of Cameron Post</em>, a coming-of-age story about a gay teen in Montana. But when <strong>anti-censorship</strong> groups questioned that decision, the school board ditched the recommended reading list altogether.</p>
<p>The <strong>FTC</strong> and <strong>Indiana</strong> attorney general are investigating the test prep company <strong>The College Network</strong> because of hundreds of complaints of deceptive practices by its salespeople. <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2014/08/09/test-preparation-predator-college-network-faces-complaints-lawsuit/13848511/">More from the IndyStar</a>.</p>

<p>A big PR push from the new for-profit &ldquo;elite&rdquo; college <strong>Minerva</strong>, with stories <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/08/15/the_minerva_project_this_for_profit_elite_college_is_a_brilliant_business.html">in Slate</a> and in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/08/the-future-of-college/375071/">The Atlantic</a>. Sound the disruption klaxon!</p>

So probably time to rethink that word &ldquo;minority,&rdquo; eh.</p>

The plan: &ldquo;collect and mentor the finest male athletes in Texas and elsewhere and become a powerhouse.&rdquo; The academics: horrible.</p>
<h2>Go, School Sports Team!</h2>
<p>A federal judge <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/judge-rules-against-ncaa-in-key-antitrust-case/83731">ruled</a> on Friday that the <strong>NCAA</strong> rules barring college athletes from sharing in the revenues from the use of their names and likenesses <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/sports/court-ruling-in-o-bannon-case-misses-a-key-element-clarity.html"><strong>violate antitrust law</strong></a>.

Although the NCAA will appeal, plenty of folks are saying that this ruling will <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/148339/">change college sports</a>. <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/08/14/ncaa-hopes-create-profit-classification">Or not</a>.</p>

She will now be on the board of directors for Scotts Miracle Gro, and I am gravely disappointed that so few &ldquo;miracle grow / test score&rdquo; puns have been made as a result.</p>
