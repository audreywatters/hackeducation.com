<p><a href="http://cbldf.org/2015/11/custom-redacted-school-texts-make-a-worrying-trend/">From the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund</a>: &#8220;Custom-Redacted School Texts Make a Worrying Trend&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the past few months we&#8217;ve noticed an uptick in a different kind of censorship from what we usually see. Namely, a few schools across the country have assigned their students to read texts that were first edited by hand: words blacked out with marker and modified from what the author wrote.</p>

<p>Unlike the more familiar cases involving challenges, review committees, and school board meetings that happen in public for all to see, these instances of unauthorized editing are more insidious. On the surface, it appears that the students are reading complex, potentially controversial texts; in reality, though, the texts have been pre-sanitized so as to avoid even the possibility of a public challenge. Not only does this practice rob the students of a well-rounded education, but it also violates both the First Amendment and U.S. copyright laws designed to protect authors&#8217; creations from tampering.</p>
