<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p>An <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2013/07/coppa.shtm">update to <strong>COPPA</strong></a>, the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act, went into effect July 1. The FTC says that the new language strengthens privacy protections, but <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/19/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-politics-of-ed-tech/">as I noted</a> when the update was revealed last year, it certainly reflects lobbying from the technology industry, particularly when it comes to contextual advertising, which sites can use to collect data <em>without</em> parental permission.</p>
<p>A Superior Court judge <a href="http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/School-s-out-for-Vallas-4637246.php">has ordered</a> well-known school reformer <strong>Paul Vallas</strong> be removed from office for failing to comply with Connecticut state rules requiring him to take a school leadership course. Vallas, who started as the superintendent of the Bridgeport Schools in 2012, is not qualified for the position, ruled Judge Barbara Bellis.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon</strong> is exploring a plan that would reshape how students in the state would pay for college. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/education/in-oregon-a-plan-to-eliminate-tuition-and-loans-at-state-colleges.html">According to The New York Times</a>, &ldquo;the Oregon Legislature approved a plan that could allow students to attend state colleges without paying tuition or taking out traditional loans. Instead, they would commit a small percentage of their future incomes to repaying the state; those who earn very little would pay very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> won an appeal this week, as the <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/58058-google-wins-appeal-authors-guild-loses-action-status.html">Second Circuit Court threw out</a> the ruling by Judge Denny Chin that had allowed the <strong>Authors Guild</strong> to claim class action status in its suit against Google&rsquo;s digitization efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma</strong>&rsquo;s state Superintendent Janet Barresi <a href="http://newsok.com/oklahoma-withdraws-from-national-college-readiness-testing-alliance/article/3858048">announced</a> that the state will not use the tests being developed by the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (<strong>PARCC</strong>), one of the new Common Core State Standards testing consortia. Among Barresi&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/article.aspx/Oklahoma_to_drop_testing_consortium_develop_own_tests/20130702_11_A1_CUTLIN399354">concerns</a>: schools&rsquo; technological readiness for the computer-based assessments. (Oklahoma was one of several states that had major problems with online testing this year.)</p>
<h2>MOOOOOOOOOOOCs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rl56qq">In an email</a> to students enrolled in his Finance MOOC being offered on the <strong>Coursera</strong> platform, <strong>Michigan</strong> professor Gautam Kaul said that he would not give out the correct answers on assignments. &ldquo;If this were a one-time class, we would have considered posting answers. It will however be very difficult for us to offer this class again if we have to keep preparing new sets of questions with multiple versions to allow you to attempt each one more than once.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/07/05/one-mooc-professor-wont-let-students-know-right-answers">Inside Higher Ed&rsquo;s Ry Rivard</a> and <a href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/07/03/youve-all-got-to-work-it-out-for-yourselves/">Colorado State University professor Jonathan Rees</a> also weigh in.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong> governor Rick Scott has signed into law a bill that would encourage schools in the state to use <strong>MOOCs for credit</strong>. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2013/07/01/watered-down-mooc-bill-becomes-law-florida">As Inside Higher Ed explains it</a>, &ldquo;The bill Scott signed allows MOOCs, under certain conditions, to be used to help teach K&ndash;12 students in four subjects and also orders Florida education officials to study and set rules that would allow students who have yet to enroll in college to earn transfer credits by taking MOOCs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> has released the latest version of its MOOC software <a href="https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/">Course Builder</a>. New features include a WYSIWYG question editor (so you don&rsquo;t need to use Javascript to build a course).</p>
<p><strong>Schoo</strong>, a Tokyo-based MOOC platform, <a href="http://www.startup-dating.com/2013/07/schoo-funding">has raised 152 million yen</a> (approximately $1.52 million) in funding.</p>

<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p>Disgraced former CIA director <strong>David Petraus</strong> is doing a stint as a visiting adjunct faculty member at <strong>CUNY</strong> this fall, and <a href="http://gawker.com/cuny-is-paying-david-petraeus-200-000-to-work-three-ho-604712137">according to Gawker</a>, the university is paying him $200,000 for a three-hour-a-week gig. &ldquo;The University is in the process of fundraising for this position,&rdquo; says CUNY.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p><a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2013/07/01/k12-teachers-out-of-pocket-1-point-6-billion-on-classroom-tools.aspx">According to a survey</a> conducted by the National School Supply and Equipment Association (NSSEA), public school teachers spent $1.6 billion of their own money on <strong>classroom supplies</strong> during this school year.

<p><a href="http://www.psmag.com/health/schoolmates-of-suicide-victims-at-higher-risk-61221/">The Pacific Standard</a> examines research recently published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal that finds that &ldquo;teens who have a classmate die of <strong>suicide</strong> are more likely to consider taking, or attempt to take, their own lives.&rdquo;</p>

So these digital inequalities that we see very early on in education, with students from lower socioeconomic statuses and areas being encouraged to use computers differently than their higher socioeconomic status peers, is clearly replicated here on Facebook, as well.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Conferences</h2>
<p>The PanelPicker is <a href="http://sxswedu.com/news/panelpicker-sxswedu-2014-now-open">open</a> for <strong>SXSWedu</strong> 2014. You can submit your session proposals through July 26.</p>

<h2>RIP</h2>

<p><strong>Jeffrey McManus</strong>, the founder of the learn-to-program company <strong><a href="http://codelesson.com">CodeLesson</a></strong>,&nbsp;passed away yesterday. Jeffrey was funny, fearless, and incredibly thoughtful about how he was building his education startup &ndash; thoughtful about the business and thoughtful about the instruction. My heart goes out to his wife and kids.</p>
