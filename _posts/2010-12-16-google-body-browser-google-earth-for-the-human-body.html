<p>Google has a new tool in Google Labs, <a href="http://bodybrowser.googlelabs.com/">Body Browser</a>.  It's similar to Google Earth in so far as it offers a way to explore a 3D model of human anatomy, including the skeleton, muscular, circulatory, digestive and nervous systems.</p>
<p>The Body Browser requires a browser that supports WebGL, which means you'll have to enable it if you're using Chrome 8 (or use the developer or canary builds of Chrome or the beta version of Firefox 4).  WebGL is still a work-in-progress, but the technology means that this sort of 3D rendering can be done in the HTML5 campus, without the use of other plugins.</p>
