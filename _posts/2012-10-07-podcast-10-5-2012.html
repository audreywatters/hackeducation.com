<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week. I think we managed to record this week's show without any technical difficulties -- thank you, Google Voice!</p>
<p>During this show, we discuss my son's decision to enlist (and what's changed since I wrote a blog post about that), Pearson CEO Marjorie Scardino's resignation, the Presidential Debates, a proposal for an ed-tech <em>Consumer Reports</em>, and Union Square Ventures' research on online education... and more.</p>
<p>The link to the MP3 of the show is below, and/or you can subscribe to  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/edtechlive/hackeducation">the podcast feed</a>. You can also find the podcast in iTunes, as part of Steve's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/edtechlive/id219875737">EdTechLive series</a>.</p>
