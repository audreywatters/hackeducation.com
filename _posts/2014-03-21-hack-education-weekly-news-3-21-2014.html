<p><em>I&rsquo;m out of the US for a week and a bit, and a cross-Atlantic flight always makes me feel like I&rsquo;ve missed out on things (or at least, I&rsquo;ve lost an entire day or so). Apologies if this week&rsquo;s round-up of news is slipshod.</em></p>
<h2>Students vs The Law</h2>
<p>A <strong>New Jersey</strong> student is <a href="http://legalclips.nsba.org/2014/03/20/new-jersey-student-disciplined-for-vulgar-off-campus-tweet-about-principal-sues-district/">suing</a> the Sterling High School District for violating her <strong>First Amendment </strong>rights after she was disciplined for a rude tweet &ndash; made after school hours and from off-campus &ndash; about her principal.</p>
<p>A <strong>Pennsylvania</strong> student is <a href="http://legalclips.nsba.org/2014/03/17/pennsylvania-student-suspended-for-off-campus-facebook-post-sues-school-district/">suing</a> his school district after he was suspended for a <strong>Facebook</strong> post he made &ndash; again, after schools hours and from off-campus.</p>
<p>Adrionna Harris, a sixth grader from Virginia Beach, <strong>Virginia</strong>, was suspended and recommended for expulsion after she took away a razor from a schoolmate who was cutting himself and reported the incident to school officials. <a href="http://wonkette.com/544627/sixth-grade-virginia-girl-gets-zero-toleranced-for-saving-classmate-from-cutting-himself">Because <strong>zero tolerance</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Education Politics</h2>
<p><strong>Wyoming</strong> has become [the first state](Next Generation Science Standards) in the US to block new national science standards. Because god forbid kids in a state that&rsquo;s funded by fossil fuels learn about global warming, amirite?</p>
<p>Students across the country will soon start <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/03/21/26fieldtests_ep.h33.html">field-testing</a> <strong>PARCC</strong>&rsquo;s new <strong>Common Core</strong>-aligned standardized tests.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Education</strong>&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights has <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/expansive-survey-americas-public-schools-reveals-troubling-racial-disparities">released</a> <strong>civil rights</strong> data compiled from all 97K+ public schools in the country. Among the findings, &ldquo;Black students represent 18% of preschool enrollment but 42% of students suspended once.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/03/maybe-black-toddlers-are-suspended-preschool-more-often-because-america-racist/359422/">Because racism</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Education</strong> has released revised &ldquo;<strong>gainful employment</strong>&rdquo; rules, which monitor for-profit and vocational programs based on their graduates&rsquo; debt levels. More <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/Revised-Gainful/145329/">via The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-26533428">According to the BBC</a>, &ldquo;Up to 60 <strong>Shanghai</strong> maths teachers are to be brought to <strong>England</strong> to raise standards, in an exchange arranged by the <strong>Department for Education</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p>Assessment startup <strong>MasteryConnect</strong> says it is &ldquo;<a href="https://www.masteryconnect.com/learn-more/reportcard.html">reinventing the report card</a>&rdquo; by moving from letter grades to &ldquo;mastery-based grading.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Instructure</strong> has also <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/instructure-unveils-new-learning-mastery-gradebook-in-canvas-250975731.html">added</a> a mastery-based gradebook in its LMS.</p>
<p><strong>Apple</strong> has <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/mobiles/Apple-discontinues-iPad-2-re-launches-iPad-4/articleshow/32241755.cms">retired</a> ye olde<strong> iPad 2</strong>, which has been the &ldquo;budget model&rdquo; for a while now. The cheapest iPad now is the iPad 4. The iPad 2 was first unveiled in March 2011 and was soooo out-of-date. Golly, I hope no schools invested heavily in these obsolescent devices!</p>
<p><a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/03/18/apple-to-shut-down-authorized-campus-stores-in-canada-this-june">AppleInsider reports</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<strong>Apple</strong>&nbsp;will shut down its Authorized Campus Stores in Canada this summer.</p>
<p><strong>2U</strong> has <a href="http://2u.com/blog/mobile-apps/">released</a> 6 new mobile apps, meaning that students in the undergrad and grad courses it offers (with its university clients) will have Android or iOS access to the 2U platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/03/19/skillshare-debuts-new-spotify-like-membership-model-for-online-education-exclusive/">According to VentureBeat</a>, <strong>Skillshare</strong> will now offer a &ldquo;Spotify-like membership model for online education.&rdquo; That is, students can opt to pay $10 a month to access courses, rather than paying for each class separately.</p>
<h2>Funding and Acquisitions</h2>
<p><strong>AltSchool</strong>, a private school founded by former Google exec Max Ventilla, has raised $33 million from Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, First Round Capital, John Doerr, Omidyar Network, Harrison Metal, Learn Capital, and Jonathan Sackler. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/AltSchool-gets-33-million-in-venture-capital-5327204.php">According to SFGate</a>, &ldquo;Ventilla plans to mostly spend it on engineers.&rdquo; The school currently has 20 students. Ventilla says &ldquo;We believe we can get the cost of an outstanding education below public school averages in the next few years while actually improving quality.&rdquo; Tuition at AltSchool is $19,100. By comparison, California spends <a href="http://edsource.org/2013/california-drops-to-49th-in-school-spending-in-annual-ed-week-report/25379#.UyxSua1_uRw">about $8,482 per pupil</a> in public K&ndash;12. So good luck engineering your way towards cost savings there, particularly, as AltSchool suggests that it&rsquo;s going to save its money by automating administrivia. California schools <a href="http://www.cbp.org/pdfs/2012/120523_Education_Funding_PB.pdf">spend</a> 5 cents of every dollar on adminstrative costs; the rest goes to instruction. So let&rsquo;s be honest here about where AltSchools plans to cut costs, eh, as it &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/18/former-googlers-altschool-raises-33m-from-founders-fund-and-a16z-to-reimagine-primary-education/">reimagines primary education</a>&rdquo; via iPads as Techcrunch breathlessly notes.</p>

This brings to <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/parchment">$47 million</a> its total investment.</p>
<p><strong>Kunerango</strong>, an Italian ed-tech startup that offers an online edu platform, has raised $129,000, <a href="http://www.edukwest.com/hedline-kunerango-raises-e100k-seed-round/">reports EduKwest</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Meducation</strong>, an &ldquo;online education network for medical students and practitioners,&rdquo; has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/19/meducation/">raised</a> $1 million (part from the UK taxpayer funded Technology Strategy Board, part from unnamed private investors).</p>

<p><strong>Gannon University</strong> will offer <a href="http://www.goerie.com/gannon-experiments-with-massive-open-online-course">a MOOC</a> on the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Douglas_Wells">Pizza Bomber</a>.&rdquo; The class will be taught by Gannon faculty member, FBI Special Agent Jerry Clark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Stanford University research center <strong>CREDO</strong> has released another report on <strong>charter schools</strong> this one focusing on schools in LA. (<a href="http://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/Los_Angeles_report_2014_FINAL_001.pdf">PDF</a>) The report finds a small benefit from charter school attendance over other public schools in the city and state. (That is, &ldquo;For the average student, charter school attendance was associated with an advantage equivalent to moving from the 50th to the 53rd percentile in reading and from the 50th to the 54th percentile in math,&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2014/03/la_charter_schools_study.html">writes Education Week</a>.)
