<p>I don&rsquo;t like going to campus much. Even though it&rsquo;s been years since I left grad school, I still fear I&rsquo;ll run into a member of my committee if I'm on or near the university. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ll ask me how my dissertation&rsquo;s coming along and when I&rsquo;ll finish. (I always run into my outside committee member. He doesn&rsquo;t ask, and I adore him for it.) They'll ask what I do now, and we'll get into a discussion about the job market. &nbsp;I'll try to explain how happy I am now, and I'll still end up sounding bitter and resentful about academia. &nbsp;So I don't go to campus much.</p>
<p>I feel an outsider, an intruder even, when I do. I don&rsquo;t know any undergrads nowadays. They're my son's age, and that feels weird. I don&rsquo;t think there are many grad students around from my cohort either. They&rsquo;re long gone. Or I hope they&rsquo;re long gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I had to go to the library today. I needed to read a book. A real book. A book in print. One that's not available online, unavailable in any digital format. It wasn&rsquo;t available in print at the local public library either.</p>
<p>So I had to go to campus.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t quickly find it in the stacks, check it out, and go. My university library privileges have long expired. I could sit and read the book there, but finding a good place to do so can be tricky -- the right spot, a spot where dissertation committee members will never see me.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;<em>thought</em>&nbsp;today I could sit and read and take notes (and tweet). &nbsp;It'd be a nice change of scenery, I tried to convince myself. &nbsp;But then, when I got inside the big brick-and-concrete building, , I couldn&rsquo;t access the Internet -- I couldn&rsquo;t log-in to the WiFi network, and I couldn&rsquo;t access 3G on my phone either. Nor could I find a table near an ethernet outlet. I&rsquo;d forgotten (or rather, I&rsquo;m oblivious) that it&rsquo;s the end-of-term. The library was full of students, studying, something that had me strangely taken aback.</p>
<p>I noticed too that the study rooms on the third floor had been converted into grad students&rsquo; office spaces. I wondered which departments had expanded there. I wondered how the space issues reflected disciplinary power, office politics, and enrollment figures. I felt bad for not paying closer attention and relieved that I didn't have to.</p>
<p>I found the book I wanted in the stacks &ndash; top floor &ndash; and I sat down to take notes by hand. I could have photocopied or snapped photos, I guess, of the pages I wanted to reference. I could have typed my notes too, I realize. But there&rsquo;s something about taking notes by hand that seemed both comfortable and right.</p>
<p>It felt right in part, I think, because this was&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ellul">Jacques Ellul&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;<em>The Technological Society</em>&nbsp;that I was looking to browse. I wanted to grab a couple of quotations from it for a presentation I&rsquo;m preparing on education, efficiency, automation, and robots. (I&rsquo;ve storified some of my notes below.)</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t linger long on campus. I just read a couple of chapters, jotted down some notes, and left. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I belonged in the university library, which was a really strange and awful feeling to have. I longed to run into one of local intellectuals,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zerzan">activists, authors, and fellow PhD dropouts</a>&nbsp;who I remember, years ago at least, would frequent the university library. But (sadly) they seemed long gone too.</p>
