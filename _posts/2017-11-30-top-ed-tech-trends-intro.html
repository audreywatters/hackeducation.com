<h3>Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2017: The Stories We&#8217;ve Been Told</h3>
<br />
<p>At the end of every year since I founded Hack Education in 2010, I&#8217;ve reviewed what I think are <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the most important and influential trends in education technology</a>. I&#8217;ve called this &#8220;the Top Ed-Tech Trends,&#8221; but this has never been an SEO-optimized list of products that the ed-tech industry wants schools or parents or companies to buy (or that it claims schools and parents and companies are buying). No, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/05/06/527140009/fidget-spinners-good-or-bad-for-kids-concentration">fidget spinners were not a &#8220;top ed-tech trend&#8221;</a> this year.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trends&#8221; is certainly a misnomer, and I&#8217;m going to start moving away from that word this year. This is about the <em>stories</em> we&#8217;re told about education, about technology, and about education technology. (No doubt, some people hope these stories fuel markets and lead to trends.)</p>

<p>This series is meant to serve in-depth exploration of the events of the past year and an analysis of how these events shape the way in which we imagine and prepare for the future of teaching and learning. We must think more critically about education technology &#8211; its technologies and its stories &#8211; and I believe that comes in part from scrutinizing its history. <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2017/10/memory-machines-and-collective-memory">The world is not changing more rapidly than ever before</a> &#8211; don&#8217;t let that story convince you to throw the past into a memory hole.</p>

<p>This series always ends up being incredibly lengthy &#8211; I apologize in advance &#8211; and this year, it threatens to be even more so. 2017 has been an extraordinary year for education news and for technology news &#8211; two areas that provide crucial context for everything that happens with education technology. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s the first year, of course, of the Trump Administration, and its attempts to change education policy and funding have been profound: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/us/politics/betsy-devos-nominee-education-secretary.html">nomination</a> of his most controversial and <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2017/09/betsy_devos_viewed_unfavorably_40_percent_voters_poll.html">unpopular</a> Cabinet member, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos; a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trumps-first-full-education-budget-deep-cuts-to-public-school-programs-in-pursuit-of-school-choice/2017/05/17/2a25a2cc-3a41-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c_story.html">budget proposal</a> that would have slashed $9 billion from the Department of Education (not to mention steep cuts to other <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/03/what-eliminating-the-arts-and-humanities-endowments-would-really-mean/519774/">education-related programs and services</a>, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/23/15682188/trump-science-budget-nih-cdc-nsf-epa-doe-energy-research-funding-cuts">funding for scientific research</a>); <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Executive-Order-Falls-Short-of/239348">battles</a> with <a href="http://www.theroot.com/morehouse-college-president-we-got-played-1792916254">HBCUs</a>; the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/09/06/trump-administration-announces-plans-wind-down-daca-after-six-months">revocation of DACA</a> and changes to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/04/12/what-do-we-know-so-far-about-changes-us-visa-and-immigration-policies">immigration</a> and <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Assessing-the-Travel-Ban-What/240548">visa</a> policies, including an increase in <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/relatives-of-undocumented-children-caught-up-in-ice-dragnet#134496">deportations</a>; the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-unesco-withdrawal.html">withdrawal from UNESCO</a>, the UN&#8217;s cultural and educational organization; Justice Department investigations into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/trump-affirmative-action-universities.html">college admissions</a> and <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Inside-the-Free-Speech-Case/241333">free speech on campuses</a>; the rollback of <a href="https://psmag.com/education/betsy-devos-rolls-back-disability-rights">regulations relating to the rights of students with disabilities</a>; the rollback of Obama-era guidance <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/What-You-Need-to-Know-About/241277">on Title IX</a> and sexual assault policies on college campuses; the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-delays-enforcement-of-obama-era-rules-on-for-profit-colleges-1488848240">delay</a> of Obama-era regulations on for-profit higher ed and reneging on <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/06/535776573/18-states-sue-betsy-devos-and-education-dept-over-delay-of-borrower-defense-rule">promises of debt relief</a> for the students defrauded by these institutions; the rollback of Obama-era <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trump-administration-rolls-back-protections-for-transgender-students/2017/02/22/550a83b4-f913-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html">protections for transgender students</a>; the rollback of Obama-era <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/dining/school-lunch-trump-obama.html">rules on school lunch standards</a> (are you sensing a trend yet?); and the scaling back of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/education-dept-closes-transgender-student-cases-as-it-pushes-to-scale-back-civil-rights-investigations/2017/06/17/08e10de2-5367-11e7-91eb-9611861a988f_story.html">investigations into civil rights violations in schools</a>.</p>

<p>All this happened in the larger context of news from the US school system itself. And again, what a year: changing demographics of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/04/14/minority-teachers-in-u-s-more-than-doubled-over-25-years-but-still-fewer-than-20-percent-of-educators-study-shows/">teachers</a> and <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Highest-Representation-of/239366">students</a> (and the <a href="https://bryanalexander.org/2017/06/27/updated-american-demographics-becoming-an-older-more-diverse-nation/">US population</a> overall);

stories that emerged well before the revelations regarding Harvey Weinstein have emboldened more <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Oxford-Professor-Is-on-Leave/241698">victims</a> to come forward and <a href="https://entropymag.org/a-refuge-for-jae-in-doe-fugues-in-the-key-of-english-major/">speak up</a>. </p>

<p>And I haven&#8217;t even touched on any news from the tech sector yet. There were scores of stories of sexual assault and sexual harassment in that industry too: accusations regarding <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber">the ride-sharing company Uber</a> &#8211; Susan Fowler really should be credited for kicking off much of the discussion of sexism and Silicon Valley culture this year; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/business/social-finance-sofi-sexual-harassment-lawsuit.html">the student loan startup SoFi</a>; <a href="https://www.axios.com/another-vc-resigns-after-accusations-of-misconduct-2458022962.html">venture capitalist Frank Artale</a>; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/technology/sexual-harassment-silicon-valley-tech.html">venture capitalist Dave McClure</a>; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html">venture capitalist Chris Sacca</a>; <a href="https://pando.com/2017/06/22/binary-capitals-justin-caldbeck-accused-unwanted-sexual-advances-towards-female-founders-wheres-outrage/">venture capitalist Justin Caldbeck</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/13/steve-jurvetson-leaving-draper-fisher-jurvetson/">venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson</a>. Then there was the infamous <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzbm4a/employees-anti-diversity-manifesto-goes-internally-viral-at-google">anti-diversity memo distributed by Google engineer James Damore</a> and leaked to the press this summer that charged that efforts the company (and the industry more broadly) had taken to address diversity were misguided as women are biologically ill-suited to computer science &#8211; which is, of course, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16153740/tech-diversity-problem-science-history-explainer-inequality">totally bullshit</a>. And then there were the revelations &#8211; although, to be fair, many people had <a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/11/16/13637310/facebook-fake-news-explained">already noticed this last year</a> &#8211; that the Internet had played a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/facebook-google-twitter-russian-interference-hearings.html">played a major role in a concerted dis-information campaign during the 2016 Presidential Election</a>, that Twitter, Facebook, and Google were (and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/google-and-facebook-have-failed-us/541794/">still are</a>) ongoing sources of misinformation, that the major technology companies have become powerful monopolies that control knowledge and information and in the process undermine democracy and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/technology/silicon-valley-baltimore-schools.html">reshape public institutions</a> to suit their needs and visions for the future.</p>

<p>One of the challenges of this end-of-year series has always been determining what is really within the purview of &#8220;education technology.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t a review of &#8220;the year in education&#8221; or &#8220;the year in tech,&#8221; after all. And yet it is naive and even misleading to pretend as though education technology exists separately from either of those &#8211; from the politics of DC, the politics of local school boards, or the politics of Silicon Valley, for example. The latter&#8217;s influence permeates education &#8211; politically, financially, and culturally; via venture capital, venture philanthropy, and lobbying efforts, and increasingly through algorithms that govern schools&#8217; and teachers&#8217; decision-making. As concerns about &#8220;fake news&#8221; make clear, Silicon Valley&#8217;s influence also extends to how we access information and build knowledge; it extends to the stories we hear and share. </p>

<p>So that&#8217;s my focus of this project this year: analyzing the stories that we have told and were told in 2017 about and by education technologies. </p>

<p>The series kicks off on Saturday, 2 December. (You can receive <a href="http://hackeducation.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0ab07657df870af8eb101b4e5&amp;id=62da8beb59">updates from Hack Education via email</a> if you prefer to read articles that way.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m fortunate to be a recipient of <a href="https://journalism.columbia.edu/spencer-education-fellowship">a Spencer Education Journalism Fellowship</a> this year. But as a reminder, Hack Education is a completely independent publication. The stories I write here are not backed by venture capital or venture philanthropy or consulting dollars. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">Readers can support my work in a number of ways</a>, but what would be awesome is if everyone took the time to think more critically about the stories they&#8217;re telling about the future of education. It&#8217;s getting pretty dystopian out there&#8230;</p>
