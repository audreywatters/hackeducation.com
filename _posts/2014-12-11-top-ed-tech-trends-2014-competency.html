<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 5 in <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com">my Top 10 Trends of 2014</a> series</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">Hype Cycle</a> to explain the adoption of technologies. The Hype Cycle is a great piece of marketing for the research firm Gartner, but I&rsquo;m not sure of its utility beyond that. Yes, sometimes it does seem like certain trends reach a &ldquo;Peak of Inflated Expectations&rdquo; then sink into the &ldquo;Trough of Disillusionment.&rdquo; But not all trends work that way, and the Hype Cycle does nothing to explain why or why not technologies become interesting or important or mainstream. There&rsquo;s not a clear timeline for adoption or rejection or &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; to emerge. As the annual <a href="http://redarchive.nmc.org/horizon-project/horizon-reports">Horizon Report</a> illustrates, for example, some technologies &ndash; hyped or not &ndash; stay on the cusp of adoption for years. Predicted to become &ldquo;a thing,&rdquo; some instead simply fade away.</p>
<p>Neither competency-based education nor alternative certification efforts have reached <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/moocs.html">the frenzied hype of MOOCs</a>. (Not much in education technology has, with the possible exception of Khan Academy.) After writing tens of thousands of words on the <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/skills.html">last</a> <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/moocs.html">two</a>) posts in this series, these trends &ndash; competency and certification &ndash; feel much smaller. Or at least this post is shorter. There is talk that competency-based education and certification are poised to become &ldquo;a thing,&rdquo; to "disrupt education," but again, I just don&rsquo;t think that change happens in ways that neatly fits into a research firm&rsquo;s or a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/clay-christensen-on-disruption-theory-apple-2014-11">business school professor&rsquo;s</a> model.</p>
<p>Growing interest this year in competency-based education and alternative certifications is certainly tied to the labor market and to the high cost of college tuition. It&rsquo;s also a reflection of the changing demographics of post-secondary students. The average age of those enrolled in the <a href="http://flex.wisconsin.edu/">Flexible Option</a>, the University of Wisconsin&rsquo;s competency-based degree program, for example: <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/10/07/353930358/competency-based-education-no-more-semesters">37</a>. And finally, competency-based initiatives are related to <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/07/02/personalization-teaching-machines">a very, very old push</a> to free students from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Unit_and_Student_Hour">&ldquo;seat-time&rdquo; and &ldquo;the credit hour&rdquo;</a> and to allow them to move through course materials &ldquo;at their own pace.&rdquo; Thanks to technology, some argue, this is increasingly possible.</p>
<p>But competency-based education is hardly new. The General Educational Development test (the GED) is over 70 years old. Initially designed to help soldiers who&rsquo;d joined the military without finishing high school demonstrate that they had academic skills equivalent to those with a HS diploma, the GED has been an important, albeit highly flawed, competency-based assessment.</p>
<p>A newly revised GED went into effect at the beginning of the year. The test is now a for-profit effort run jointly by Pearson and the non-profit American Council on Education (ACE). The new exam is aligned with the Common Core (the next trend in this series!), and it&rsquo;s proven to be <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0914/morningeducation15134.html">more difficult to pass</a> (just 53% of test-takers now pass, as opposed to 72% under the older version). The new exam is more expensive as well. The price has gone up to $120, and you&rsquo;re now charged $30 each time you retake it. As a result, the number of those taking the test has plunged. During the first half of the year, only 105,000 had taken the test; in the past, about 750,000 typically take the test each year.</p>
<p>As this change highlights, it's worth asking who benefits from, who profits from competency-based programs, and how?</p>
