<p>Despite my general fear of mathematics, I would be remiss if I did not call your attention to this <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> project:  <strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1541803748/punk-mathematics">Punk Mathematics</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The project has already exceeded its pledge goal on Kickstarter (if you're not familiar with Kickstarter, the site allows you to "crowdfund" your projects) with almost 700 folks offering their support, but hey, there is still time to contribute.  Sadly, the "Answer-to-Everything Pack" is sold out (this included the cellphone number to project creator Tom Henderson, so that he could answer your math questions 24-7).</p>
<p>Henderson, of the <a href="http://www.mathforprimates.com/">Math for Primates podcast</a> fame, says that Punk Mathematics will be "written for readers who are interested in having their minds expanded by the strange metaphors and implications of mathematics, even if they're not always on friendly terms with equations. Better living through probability; the fractal dimension of cities and cancers; using orders of magnitude to detect bullshit; free will and quantum economics; and the mathematics of cooperation in a networked world on the brink of a No Future collapse."</p>
<p>For more background on Henderson and insight into the praxis of punk math, read Klint Finley's interview over at <a href="http://technoccult.net/archives/2010/02/25/the-punk-rock-philosophy-of-mathematics-technoccult-interviews-tom-henderson/">Technoccult</a>.</p>
