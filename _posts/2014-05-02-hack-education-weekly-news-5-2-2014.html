<p>The big huge major celebrity-filled edu news this week: comedian <strong>Louis CK</strong> <a href="https://storify.com/audreywatters/louis-ck-vs-the-common-core">tweeted</a> in frustration about his kids&rsquo; math homework. And really that&rsquo;s all we need to know: a famous parent questioned <strong>standardized testing</strong> and the<strong> Common Core</strong>.</p>
<p>Or at least, that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s necessary to spawn a zillion &ldquo;think pieces&rdquo; &ndash; whether he was wrong or right or funny or dull or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather stop right there, frankly, and call it a wrap for the week &ndash; if other important stuff hadn&rsquo;t also happened.</p>
<h2>Elsewhere in Standardized Testing&hellip;</h2>
<p>A <strong>Florida</strong> elementary school will <a href="http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2014/04/23/Florida-elementary-school-stops-serving-Mountain-Dew-before-standardized-tests/4501398278191">no longer offer Mountain Dew</a> to students pre-test. If their scores suffer, I hope some Dew-sponsored celebrity intervenes on Twitter. For justice&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2014/04/30/16498/ipad-wifi-issues-interrupt-la-schools-testing/">The great <strong>LAUSD</strong> iPad saga continues</a>: this time WiFi issues in the schools are getting in the way of testing. (Because clearly testing is the reason for buying all those expensive devices.)</p>
<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Homeland Security</strong> is <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/04/28/307763583/u-s-tells-users-to-stop-using-internet-explorer-for-now">warning</a> Americans not to use <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Educatio</strong>n <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-finds-tufts-university-massachusetts-violation-title-ix-">announced</a> that it found <strong>Tufts University</strong> in violation of <strong>Title IX</strong> because of the school&rsquo;s failure to address sexual assault and sexual harassment on campus.</p>
<p>And now the <strong>Obama Administration</strong> insists <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/146255/">it&rsquo;s on the case</a>. <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i">Here are the 55 institutions it&rsquo;s investigating for <strong>Title IX</strong> related violations</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://gawker.com/parents-call-cops-to-stop-kids-from-handing-out-banned-1569491566">Parents Call Cops to Stop Kids From Handing Out Banned Book</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An <strong>FDA advisory panel</strong> has <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/defending-targets-discrimination/shocking-kids-compliance">recommend</a> that, yes, we should ban &ldquo;<strong>aversive conditioning devices</strong>&rdquo; &ndash; electric shock treatment still used in schools to manage and discipline students with disabilities.</p>
<p>The state of <strong>Virginia</strong> will <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/us/dreamers-eligible-for-in-state-tuition-virginias-attorney-general-says.html">offer</a> in-state tuition to &ldquo;<strong>Dreamers</strong>,&rdquo; children brought to the United States illegally by their parents and raised here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/us/florida-set-to-offer-in-state-tuition-to-children-brought-to-us-illegally.html">The state of <strong>Florida</strong> will also offer in-state tuition to Dreamers</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong>California</strong> appellate court has ruled that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-teacher-ratings-20140425,0,4616188.story#axzz2zol0hkL1"><strong>LAUSD</strong> does not have to release</a> teachers&rsquo; names in conjunction with their performance ratings, something that the LA Times had been seeking.</p>
<p>The <strong>English</strong> government is <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-04/25/national-pupil-database">sharing</a> (not selling) student data from its <strong>National Pupil Database</strong>. Because &ldquo;open data.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>MOOCs</h2>
<p>e-Literate offers <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/new-e-literate-tv-series-moocs/">its latest web TV show</a> on <strong>MOOCs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> announced that, despite raising over $85 million in venture capital, it would turn to &ldquo;the community&rdquo; to translate its courses. Nicholas Carr calls this &ldquo;<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/?p=4464">sharecropping</a>&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Translation is not play; it&rsquo;s work &mdash; and skilled work at that. What Coursera is doing seems more like plain old chicanery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But hey. <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/84162491702/we-won-not-one-but-two-webbys-awards"><strong>Coursera</strong> won some Webbys</a> &ndash; which much like this new vision of MOOCs, do cost money to be a part of.</p>
<p>As part of a pilot program with <strong>Coursera</strong>, the <strong>New York Public Library</strong> plans to hold <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/new-york-public-library-plans-face-to-face-classes-for-mooc-students/52147">face-to-face &ldquo;classes&rdquo;</a> for MOOC students.</p>
<p><strong>Dominican University of California</strong> will be <strong>Coursera</strong>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/01/dominican-u-host-first-coursera-learning-hub-us-institution">first official &ldquo;learning hub&rdquo;</a> at a US university.</p>
<p>And now for something completely different: <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=2260">an open online course taught this summer by <strong>Gardner Campbell</strong></a>: &ldquo;UNIV 200: Inquiry and the Craft of Argument. Digital Engagement Pilot. Alternate title: &lsquo;Living the Dreams: Digital Investigation and Unfettered Minds.&rsquo; Organizing principle: Thought Vectors In Concept Space.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Meanwhile on Campus</h2>
<p><strong>MIT</strong> plans to <a href="http://bitcoin.mit.edu/announcing-the-mit-bitcoin-project/">give</a> every undergraduate student $100 in <strong>Bitcoin</strong> in order to create &ldquo;an ecosystem for digital currencies.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Go Sports Team</h2>
<p><strong>University of Oregon</strong> president Gofffredson is <a href="http://dailyemerald.com/2014/04/29/president-gottfredson-to-appoint-an-interim-athletic-advisory-council/">dismantling</a> the UO Intercollegiate Athletics Committee, a faculty group with oversight into the university&rsquo;s athletics program. I&rsquo;m sure the removal of shared governance will be great. Go Ducks.</p>
<p><strong>UCLA</strong> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-donald-sterling-foundation-ucla-cancels-gift-20140429,0,2760188.story#axzz30NhZrV5X">cancelled</a> a $3 million gift from the Sterling Foundation on the heels of a tape that captured Donald Sterling, the owner of the LA Clippers, uttering racist statements about who he wanted to attend NBA basketball games. Sterling has been awful for a long time, but this is the thing that prompted UCLA to cancel the check. Interesting...</p>
<h2>Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Google</strong> <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2014/04/protecting-students-with-google-apps.html">announced</a> this week that it would stop data-mining the emails in Google Apps for Education. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve permanently removed all ads scanning in Gmail for Apps for Education, which means Google cannot collect or use student data in Apps for Education services for advertising purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Chegg</strong> and <strong>Kno</strong> founder Osman Rashid is on to the next new edu thing: <strong>Galxyz</strong>. The new startup offers content/assessment aligned to the new Next Generation Science Standards: &ldquo;Kids will fight their nemesis King Dullard and his minions while hunting for fun-filled curiosity particles across galaxies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>Discovery Channel </strong>launched a new show called <em>Bad Teacher</em>, one of those staged-reality-TV things that gets lots of rubbernecking viewers and does little to forward things like, oh say, <a href="http://blog.discoveryeducation.com/blog/2014/04/28/we-love-amazing-teachers/">the company&rsquo;s education mission</a>. Thanks to teacher outcry &ndash; and some pushback from <strong>Discovery Education</strong> &ndash; the show was <a href="http://blog.discoveryeducation.com/blog/2014/04/29/good-news-from-discovery-education/">promptly cancelled</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Counterterrorism</strong> software from Intelligent Software Solutions will now be <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/04/30/counterterror-software-to-become-counter-dropout-tool.aspx">marketed</a> to campuses to help identify students who might drop out. What could go wrong?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mountain View-based startup <strong>Collegefeed</strong>, a social network for higher students with a focus on career prospects has launched a new platform called Collegefeed for Career Centers.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.edukwest.com/hedline-collegefeed-launches-technology-platform-university-career-centers/">More via Edukwest</a>.</p>
<p>The publisher Lawrence &amp; Wishart <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/146251/">wants</a> the &ldquo;<strong>Marxists Internet Archive</strong>, a volunteer-run online collection of socialist writers&rsquo; works, to remove from the website copyrighted material from the publisher&rsquo;s <em>Marx Engels Collected Works</em> by April 30.&rdquo; To the barricades!

(Worth noting: Duolingo is the brainchild of Luis von Ahn, who created CAPTCHA. So let&rsquo;s hope folks can translate English better than I can translate CAPTCHAs.)</p>
