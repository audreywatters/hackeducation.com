<p>I know I just wrote <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/10/27/claim-your-domain/">a blog post with nearly the same headline</a> less than two weeks ago, but here I go again: <a href=http://monsters2.hackeducation.com>my latest book is now available for purchase</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/cover_for_blog2.png"></p>

<p><em><strong><a href="http://monsters2.hackeducation.com">The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</a></em></strong> is the sequel, if you will, to last year&#8217;s similarly titled book. And like <em><a href="http://monsters.hackeducation.com">The Monsters of Education Technology</a></em>, this one is a collection of all the keynotes and talks I delivered in 2015 &#8211; eleven altogether, plus one essay I wrote specifically for this book.</p>

<p>E-book versions are available for purchase via the usual online retailers: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B017QLPMIU">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/591492">Smashwords</a> (for now. Wider distribution coming soon). Even better: <strong>you can buy from me directly</strong> <a href="https://gumroad.com/audreywatters#">via Gumroad</a>. You can purchase a <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/UJoDE#">MOBI</a>, <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/tqsJK#">ePUB</a>, or <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/hzSxg#">PDF</a> version for $4.99.</p>

<p>Coming soon: a print version as well as audiobooks for both <em>Monsters</em> publications. (When the latter is available, I will make &#8220;bundles&#8221; for sale so you can buy the e- and audiobooks together.)</p>

<p>As always, thanks for supporting my work.</p>
