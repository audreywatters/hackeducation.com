<p>Even though only a few people have had their <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/15/samsung-series-5-chromebook/">hands on</a> Google's new Chromebooks, we've heard all sorts of opinions about whether or not the new cloud-only devices will be a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/will_chromebooks_for_education_be_a_good_deal_for.php">good deal</a> or <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-chromebooks-2011-5">DOA</a> when they're officially available this summer.</p>
<p>There's also been some confusion about the Chromebook offerings, in part because <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/quentinhardy/2011/05/10/google-to-announce-chrome-laptops-20month/">rumors</a> of student rentals published prior to Google's announcement mischaracterized the way in which that program will actually work.  (It's not going to be the educational discount whereby students show a School ID in order to get cheaper hardware; it's a contract agreement with the institution -- a three year contract -- to rent the devices.)</p>
<p>Whether people choose to buy Chromebooks outright or whether schools offer them for rent, the question still remains:  will students actually adopt Chromebooks?</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology_and_learning/google_s_chromebook_lms_limitation">Inside Higher Ed's Joshua Kim</a>, in order for Chromebooks to have any hope in the education market, it will require "a Google LMS if Google hopes to significantly displace Microsoft or <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> in higher ed."  I'm not sure I agree.  Neither Apple nor Microsoft have an LMS integrated with their operating systems.  And I really don't see the LMS as the linchpin here.</p>
<p><strong>The linchpin, I believe, is the availability of Web apps.  And that's what might cause Google to fail.</strong></p>
<p>For Google's cloud-based OS to work for the vast majority of college students, they'll need to be able to access the tools they need via the browser.  That'll be a challenge for a lot of college students (less so for the K-12 crowd, many of whom are already adapt at "life inside the browser" -- and honestly, I think that's really the target market for Chromebooks).</p>
<p>It's a matter of mindset.  But it's a matter of app availability as well.</p>
<p>That's not to say that the devices and their cloud-based OS won't work for most college students' needs, particularly as universities build out better virtualization options for discipline-specific software that was once found only in computer labs.  But a lot of Web apps feel like also-rans to their downloaded equivalents.  I'm looking at the list of apps I have open right now on my Mac and i know it'd be a struggle for me to move away from the downloaded versions of TweetDeck, Evernote, Skype, and Steam -- some of which do have Web versions; some don't.</p>
<p>Despite my reliance on these downloaded apps, I am moving closer to a Web-only world myself, and I certainly haven't touched Microsoft Office in well over a year.  (So please, don't tell me students won't use Google Apps because they need Office so they can submit essays as .doc's.  Google Docs lets you export files into that format.)</p>
<p>But even if the Web apps students need are available by the beginning of the school year, that's just part of the battle.  There are a number of educational websites that just don't work with Chrome  That might include the LMSes that Joshua Kim frets about -- I don't know.  But it definitely includes <a href="http://fafsa.ed.gov">FAFSA</a>.  And let me tell ya, not being able to submit financial aid requests on your Chromebook will be a big stumbling block for Google.</p>
<p>So it isn't just a matter of the Chromebook being ready for students.  It's a matter of the Web and the Chrome Web Store being ready.  Can Google get those pieces in place by the Fall?</p>
