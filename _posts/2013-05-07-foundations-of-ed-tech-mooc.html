<p><a href="http://www.veletsianos.com/">George Veletsianos</a>&nbsp;(an Associate Professor in the&nbsp;<span>School of Education and Technology at</span>&nbsp;Royal Roads University in Victoria, BC) and I have submitted an application for Iversity&rsquo;s <a href="https://moocfellowship.org">MOOC production fellowship program</a>. If funded, we will co-teach a course titled &ldquo;<a href="https://moocfellowship.org/submissions/foundations-of-educational-technology">Foundations of Educational Technology</a>.&rdquo; (If not funded, we&rsquo;ll figure something else out&hellip;)</p>
<p>The course will tackle something that I continue to <a href="/2012/03/17/what-every-techie-should-know-about-education/">write</a> and <a href="/2013/05/04/ed-tech-argo-f-k-yourself/">rant</a> about: a lack of understanding of the history, research, practices, and debates of education technology.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t simply that, as Santayana famously said, that &ldquo;those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s also that folks might misdiagnose the present and as such misdirect us in the future.</p>
<p>In order to improve education and ed-tech, we think it&rsquo;s important to know the answers to a number of questions including</p>
<ul>
<li>how do people learn?&nbsp;</li>
<li>how does technology/pedagogy impact learning?&nbsp;</li>
<li>why have educational technology efforts failed/succeeded in the past?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our course will explore some of the answers to (in part by highlighting the debates surrounding) these questions. The class will draw on openly-available content and on the pedagogies and practices of cMOOCs.</p>
<p>The recipients of the Iversity MOOC fellowship will be chosen through a combination of peer review and public voting, and George and I would love your support for the latter. To <a href="https://moocfellowship.org/submissions/foundations-of-educational-technology">vote for our proposal</a>, you do have to register on the platform (ugh) first. You can also read more about the class there.</p>
<p>George has more details&nbsp;<a href="http://www.veletsianos.com/2013/05/07/vote-for-our-mooc-production-fellowship-application/">on his blog too</a>, including an awesome list of other friends, colleagues, professors, and grad students who&rsquo;ve volunteered to help.</p>
