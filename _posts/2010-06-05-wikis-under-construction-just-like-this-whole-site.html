<p>Although this site is a culmination of a lot of years' work and consideration, it's very much "under construction" at the moment.</p>
<p>I did get <a href="https://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a> set up today, which gives me access to <a href="mailto:">email</a>, docs, calendar, and wikis.</p>
<p>It's the latter that's particularly important. I've created two <a href="http://wiki.hackeducation.com">wikis</a>: one for edtech blogs and one for edtech startups. Of course, when I say created, I really do mean created -- there's hardly any data there at all. But both are public, and hopefully both can be filled with useful information.</p>
