<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>The US House of Representatives was supposed to vote last week on ESEA reauthorization, but the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/republican-backed-no-child-left-behind-vote-collapses-in-the#.joB5bY695">vote collapsed</a> because of conservative opposition to the proposed bill. (&#8220;<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2015/03/how_a_conservative_blogger_hel.html">How a Conservative Blogger Helped Derail the House NCLB Rewrite</a>.&#8221;)</p>

<p>The Department of Education <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/03/02/us-ends-contract-5-debt-collectors-citing-misrepresentations-borrowers">severed ties</a> with five companies it had contracted to collect student loans after finding they made &#8220;materially inaccurate representation&#8221; to borrowers. Meanwhile an employee of the department has committed <a href="http://dailym.ai/1B42zTU">identity theft</a> using students&#8217; loan applications.</p>

<p>A bill in New Hampshire will <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/03/05/new-hampshire-bill-requires-cursive-multiplication_ap.html">require</a> students to learn cursive and their multiplication tables. It&#8217;s part of the pushback against the Common Core, which omits learning cursive as part of the curriculum.</p>

<p>Legislators in Arizona have decided to completely eliminate state support for its three largest community college districts, including Maricopa and Pima. <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/03/06/arizona-budget-deal-would-eliminate-all-state-funds-3-large-community-college">More details via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>

<p>Wyoming governor Matt Mead has <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/wyoming-schools-could-soon-teach-that-global-warming-is-real/386677/">signed a bill</a> that will allow the topic of climate change to be taught in the state.</p>

<p>Last month, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker insisted that it was a &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/opinion/gov-scott-walkers-drafting-error.html">drafting error</a>&#8221; when his proposal to axe higher education funding also rewrote the University of Wisconsin&#8217;s mission statement. This time, it&#8217;s Tennessee&#8217;s turn to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/03/03/u-tennessee-system-backtracks-de-tenure-language">plead &#8220;typo,&#8221;</a> saying it didn&#8217;t mean to use the phrase &#8220;de-tenure&#8221; to describe its new cost-saving plans.</p>

<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/02/27/kansas-senate-wants-to-impriso.html">Kansas Senate Bill 56</a> would allow teachers who distribute &#8220;harmful material&#8221; to students be criminally prosecuted.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/nyc-charter-will-close-for-rally">Some 9000 students</a> from NYC&#8217;s charter school chain Success Academies were bussed to Albany to participate in a pro-charter school rally.</p>

<p>CUNY adjunct professor (and former CIA director) David Petraeus <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/david-petraeus-guilty-plea-deal-obama-leaks/386731/">reached a plea deal</a> for leaking classified information to his mistress/biographer. Unlike other leaders, he won&#8217;t serve jail time. He&#8217;ll pay a $40,000 file and get 2 years of probation.</p>

<p>Former Atlanta public schools superintendent Beverly Hall <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/central-figure-in-the-atlanta-schools-cheating-scandal-dies.html">passed away this week</a>. Hall was awaiting trial for her role in the district&#8217;s cheating scandal.</p>

<h3>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h3>
<br />
<p>Stan Lee is teaching a MOOC via edX. &#8220;<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/rise-superheroes-impact-pop-culture-smithsonianx-popx1-1x?utm_source=edX+Course+Announcements+Mailing+List&amp;utm_campaign=1d7948b322-Student_Newsletter_March_3_v2&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_237694b56d-1d7948b322-79338601#.VPn77UYz5DB">When you complete a verified certificate in this course it will feature original artwork with both Stan Lee's and Michael Uslan's signature</a>.&#8221; &#8211; so that&#8217;ll help the edX bottom line, amirite. I mean, they got my $50. </p>

<p>Alibaba and Peking University are <a href="http://www.edukwest.com/edbrief-alibaba-and-peking-university-launch-chinese-moocs/">launching a MOOC platform</a>.</p>

<p>Udemy <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-02-27-udemy-s-top-10-instructors-top-17m-in-earnings">boasts</a> that its top 10 instructors have earned more than $17 million on the &#8220;MOOC&#8221; platform. </p>

<p>Coursera has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/03/06/coursera-apologizes-translation-quality-tweet">apologized</a> for a tweet (later deleted) arguing that its crowdsourced translation efforts were superior to professional translators. Paul-Olivier Dehaye <a href="https://storify.com/podehaye/what-is-going-on-with-the-coursera-global-translat">storified</a> some of the exchange.</p>

<h3>Meanwhile on Campus</h3>
<br />
<p>Sweet Briar College <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/03/04/sweet-briar-college-will-shut-down">announced</a> this week that it plans to close its doors at the end of the academic year. The all-women&#8217;s private liberal arts college in Virginia has a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/03/05/where-will-sweet-briars-85m-endowment-go">sizable endowment (~$80 million)</a>, but its board voted to close nonetheless, citing declining interest in the school. &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/03/04/shock-over-sweet-briars-closing-turns-to-determination-to-keep-college-alive/?wprss=rss_education">Shock</a>&#8221; seemed to be the <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/228233/">common response</a> to the news &#8211; other than &#8220;Sweet Briar College? Never heard of it&#8221; of course. That hasn&#8217;t stopped the &#8220;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/228231/">what other colleges can learn</a>&#8221;-type stories.</p>

<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Raped-on-Campus-Don-t-Trust/228093/">Officials at the University of Oregon</a> &#8220;accessed the rape survivor's therapy records from its counseling center and handed them over to its general counsel’s office to help them defend against her lawsuit.&#8221; The university claimed FERPA gave them the right to do so.</p>

<p>The University of North Carolina Board of Governors has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/03/02/unc-board-kills-3-centers-amid-criticism-action-violates-academic-freedom">voted</a> to close research centers: &#8220;a poverty center at the Chapel Hill campus, a biodiversity center at East Carolina University and a civic engagement and social change center at North Carolina Central University.&#8221; Notice a theme? The board&#8217;s chair insists the decision isn&#8217;t political. Mmmhmmm.</p>

<p>Lynn University gives free iPads to its students. &#8220;Now,&#8221; <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/free-ipads-with-a-catch-theyll-squeal-if-you-cut-class/55937">reports The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, &#8220;If those students cut class, their iPads might tattle on them.&#8221; An app called Class120 keeps an eye on students&#8217; locations, using GPS.</p>

<p>Students at University of California Santa Cruz <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/social-affairs/20150305/ucsc-protests-block-campus-entrances">blocked campus entrances</a> this week, protesting UC tuition hikes.</p>

<h3>Standardized Testing</h3>
<br />
<p>It&#8217;s the start of standardized testing season across the US, and there were a number of problems and <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/03/florida_testing_woes_persist_a.html">breakdowns</a> and delays with online assessments this week across <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2015/03/several_fla_counties_suspend_online_testing_waiting_on_state_fix.html">counties</a> <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/03/online_testing_rolls_forward_i_1.html">in Florida</a>.

<p>&#8220;Medical professionals in many big-time college football programs are using deliberately vague language about head injuries or avoiding mention of concussions on injury reports as public scrutiny of the problem has increased,&#8221; <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/190495/">reports The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheerleaders from Albany State and Tuskegee Universities were sent home after they got into a fight at a basketball tournament.&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/03/06/cheerleaders-sent-home-after-fight-caught-video">Viral video from HBCU Sports</a>.</p>

<p>Also joining the Department of Education: <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-03-03-ms-stevens-goes-to-washington">Katrina Stevens</a>.</p>

Uber’s former head of global security Michael Ginty has been appointed to head of safety at AltSchool. Former Rocket Fuel VP Sue Yoon and former Zynga Director of Product Rajiv Bhatia are also joining.&#8221; Because education is an engineering problem, clearly. </p>

<p>Once boasting that its main future was that it safely allowed one-way communication from teachers to students, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-03-03-remind-releases-two-way-messaging-feature">Remind will soon allow two-way conversations via its app</a>.</p>

The site reviews textbooks and educational materials to see how well they&#8217;re aligned to the Common Core. (Spoiler alert: they&#8217;re not.)</p>

<p>Clever has revised its privacy policy, a move that gets <a href="http://funnymonkey.com/blog/clever-updates-their-privacy-policy-and-does-it-well">&#8220;kudos&#8221; from Funnymonkey&#8217;s Bill Fitzgerald</a>. Indeed, the idea of putting the policy on GitHub so that you can easily track changes is a great one.</p>

<p>The Wired headline reads &#8220;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/online-game-thatll-help-pay-off-student-debt/">An Online Game That'll Help Pay Off Your Student Debt</a>.&#8221; Actually you get $.50 if you win a round on the app&#8217;s trivia game. $.30 of that goes to pay a service fee. So at that rate, I&#8217;d need to play about 100,000 rounds before I had my debt paid off. That does nothing to address larger structural questions about student loan debt, but hey, this is clearly technosolutionism at its best/worst.</p>

<p>The conservative ed-reform publication Education Next is celebrating (yes, celebrating) the 50 year anniversary of the Moynihan Report, which helped pathologize Black women as &#8220;welfare queens&#8221; and Black men as &#8220;deadbeat dads.&#8221; Michael Petrelli gleefully trolled Black Twitter with the cover of its latest magazine. </p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Something tells me that <a href="https://twitter.com/citizenstewart">@citizenstewart</a> isn&#39;t going to like this <a href="https://twitter.com/EducationNext">@EducationNext</a> cover design <a href="http://t.co/yJ2k7YxFt8">http://t.co/yJ2k7YxFt8</a> <a href="http://t.co/fYiOQUI3Y9">pic.twitter.com/fYiOQUI3Y9</a></p>&mdash; Michael Petrilli (@MichaelPetrilli) <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelPetrilli/status/572796417175126016">March 3, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>Now <a href="http://edexcellence.net/articles/an-apology">Petrelli says</a> he&#8217;s sorry for sending the tweets. (No apology for the cover itself.)

<p>&#8220;Nationally, 37,327 students took the AP CS A exam in 2014,&#8221; reports Mark Guzdial. &#8220;This was a big increase (26.29%) from the 29,555 students who took it in 2013.&#8221; More details based on the research of Barbara Ericson <a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2015/03/04/ap-cs-2014-results-big-jumps-in-participation/">on Guzdial&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;A damning report on how the University of Minnesota (UM) protects volunteers in its clinical trials concludes that researchers inadequately reviewed research studies across the university and need more training to better protect the most vulnerable subjects,&#8221; <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/education/2015/03/human-subjects-protections-under-fire-university-minnesota">reports Science</a>.</p>

While TFA members teaching pre-K through second grade were more effective at raising student achievement in reading, the study didn’t find any statistical difference between corps members and their peers in upper grades in either math or reading.&#8221;</p>
