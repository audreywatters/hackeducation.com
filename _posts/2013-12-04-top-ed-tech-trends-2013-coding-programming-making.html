<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 5 of my <a href="http://2013trends.hackeducation.com">Top 10 Ed-Tech Trends of 2013</a> Series</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em> <a title="Robot on the Taff by JohnGreenaway, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johngreenaway/3356358479/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3450/3356358479_a0e3ee8a05.jpg" alt="Robot on the Taff" width="500" height="333" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In memory of Jeffrey McManus, founder of CodeLesson and friend</em></p>
<p>As with all of the trends I&rsquo;m covering in my year-end review, neither the &ldquo;Learn to Code&rdquo; nor the &ldquo;Maker Movement&rdquo; are new. I&rsquo;ll say it again: read Seymour Papert&rsquo;s <em>Mindstorms</em>, published in 1980.</p>
<p>Last year, I wrote about &ldquo;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/11/27/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-learning-to-code">Learning to Code</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/11/21/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-maker-movement">The Maker Movement</a>&rdquo; in two separate trends post. This year, I&rsquo;m combining the two. This decision shouldn&rsquo;t be seen as an indication that interest in either has diminished. To the contrary.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s certainly been a surge this year in the number of organizations, companies, and initiatives trying to stir up and serve that interest. An abbreviated list of those in the news this year: <strong>Mozilla</strong> (which has continued to expand its Web literacy efforts, developing <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard">standards</a> to help conceptualize and promote a better understanding of the Web); <strong>littleBits</strong> (which I chose as <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/08/top-10-ed-tech-startups-of-2011">one of my favorite ed-tech startups in 2011</a> and which <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/20/littlebits-lands-11m-to-make-its-snapable-electronics-a-platform-for-future-hardware-makers/">raised</a> $11 million in investment this year); <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> (<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/08/top-10-ed-tech-startups-of-2011">another one of my favorite startups from 2011</a> which was used in a number of <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.fr/2013/09/coder-simple-way-to-make-web-stuff-on.html">interesting</a> projects and <a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2013/11/putting-the-wolfram-language-and-mathematica-on-every-raspberry-pi/">partnerships</a> and which recently announced it has sold <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5265">2 million units</a>); the <strong>Imagine Cup</strong> (Microsoft&rsquo;s college-level programming competition, which expanded to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2013/mar13/03-19koduchallengepr.aspx">younger students</a>); <strong>Starter League</strong> (formerly known as Code Academy, which <a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2013/january_2013/mayor_emanuel_unveilsinnovativepartnershipwiththestarterleagueto.html">partnered with the Chicago Public Schools</a> in order to teach teachers Web development);

<strong>Skillshare</strong> (which offers a variety of classes, not just programming ones &ndash; offline and now online &ndash; and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/31/with-a-fresh-1m-from-zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh-skillshare-looks-to-expand-its-course-menu-and-go-big-abroad/">raised</a> $1 million in funding);

<strong>Caine&rsquo;s Arcade</strong> (which has encouraged a lot of cardboard-based building and will continue to do so even though Caine himself &ldquo;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/caines-arcade/caine-is-retiring-but-caines-arcade-is-not-closing/496010163807487">retired</a>&rdquo;); <strong>Codecademy</strong> (which launched to a lot of learn-to-code hoopla, but was <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/01/09/codeacademy-adding-api-training-with-youtube-npr-bit-ly/">fairly quiet this year</a> save <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/430141/october-31-2013/zach-sims">an appearance on the Colbert Report</a>); <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/11/29/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-moocs">MOOCs galore</a>; <strong>MakerBot</strong> (which was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/19/stratasys-acquiring-makerbot-combined-company-will-likely-dominate-3d-printing-industry/">acquired</a> by Stratasys and launched <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/academy/">MakerBot Academy</a> with &ldquo;a mission to put a MakerBot Desktop 3D Printer in every school in the United States of America&rdquo;);

and of course MIT&rsquo;s <strong>Scratch</strong> (still among the very best ways to introduce kids to programming and which launched <a href="http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_2.0">version 2.0</a> &ndash; a web-based version &ndash; in 2013).</p>
