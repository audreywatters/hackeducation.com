<p>Earlier this week,<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/12/13/stanfords-open-courses-raise-questions-about-true-value-elite-education"><em>Inside Higher Ed'</em>s Steve Kolowich</a>looked at the success Stanford University has had this fall by offering 3 of its engineering courses online. The courses -- Introductions to<a href="http://ai-class.com/">Artificial Intelligence</a>,<a href="http://www.ml-class.org/course/auth/welcome">Machine Learning</a>, and<a href="http://www.db-class.org/course/auth/welcome">Databases</a>-- were available on the Web for free; anyone could register, and<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/science/16stanford.html">hundreds of thousands</a>of people did.</p>
<p>It's hardly a new idea to put university course materials online. Indeed,<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT Opencourseware</a>celebrated its 10th anniversary this year. (For an interesting look at how discussions about open education and online education have and haven't changed over the past decade, I recommend reading<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/04/us/auditing-classes-at-mit-on-the-web-and-free.html?src=pm">the 2001 New York Times story</a>announcing MIT's initiative.)</p>
<p>But the focus of MIT and other universities that are part of the<a href="http://www.ocwconsortium.org/">OpenCourseWare Consortium</a>is just that --<em>courseware</em>. Course materials are freely available online -- syllabi, notes, exams, handouts -- and the material is licensed<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>. But there is no access to the instructor. There is no interaction with other students (I should clarify: these things might happen, but it isn't part of the OCW design and isn't part of the university's expectations or responsibility.)</p>
<p>The Stanford online experiment this fall is something different...</p>
