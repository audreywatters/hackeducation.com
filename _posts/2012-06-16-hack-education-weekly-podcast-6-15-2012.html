<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest education/technology news. I always enjoy our conversations, and this week was no exception. We were aided, of course, by the news we had to discuss: &nbsp;untinkerable MacBooks, standardized tests on iPads, Chuck E. Cheese, and "galvanic skin response" bracelets.</p>
<p><strong>1:15</strong>: &nbsp;Apple's WWDC announcements highlighted how much the company believes in <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/12/white-macbook-ipad-education/">control</a>. &nbsp;What are the implications for education if this is the hardware and operating system (and app ecosystem) we adopt?</p>
<p><strong>18:55</strong>: &nbsp;"No holds barred," says Steve. &nbsp;"What was Nolan Bushnell talking about" at the recent <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/13/launchedu/">LAUNCH</a> event?</p>
<p><strong>29:00</strong>: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/15/instructure-canvas-learning-analytics/">Instructure has a big week</a>, holding its user conference, unveiling a learning analytics feature, and announcing a contract with Cisco Networking Academy (that's 1+ million students).</p>
<p><strong>38:00</strong>: &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/15/hack-education-weekly-news/">weekly news</a>, including a shout-out to 9 year-old food-blogger Martha Payne and a raised eyebrow at "galvanic skin response" bracelets.</p>
