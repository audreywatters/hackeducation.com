<p><a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/udacitys-cs101-partial-course-evaluation">Lately</a>&nbsp;when I write about MOOCs (and I admit, I do&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/courseras-cs101-completed">write about MOOCs a lot</a>&nbsp;lately), I feel the need to attach a bunch of adjectives to clarify what I mean by the term: the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/science/16stanford.html">Stanford-model MOOC</a>. New MOOCs. The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course#History">OG MOOC</a>. The ur-MOOC. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.edxonline.org/">MOOCs-come-lately</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://coursera.org/">VC MOOCs</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://udacity.com/">Tech MOOCs</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/university-venus/problem-edx">Mother of all MOOCs</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://change.mooc.ca/">Change11</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://ds106.us/">DS106</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/ed-tech-macguffin">MOOCGuffin</a>&nbsp;(I just totally made that up. Sorry.).</p>
<p>Regardless, it&rsquo;s clear to me that there&rsquo;s a failure of acronyms here -- too bad since acronyms are supposed to serve as an obvious shorthand, spelling out the initials of exactly what we mean. As in: MOOC. Massive Online Open Course. It&rsquo;s clear what we mean by the term. Except it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Massive&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;How do we define &ldquo;massive&rdquo;? How big? How many students? How much participation? Do we rate everything in terms of the Stanford AI class now? In other words: less than 100K isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;massive,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;really big.&rdquo; How does this relate to class size on campus? See: Virginia Tech geography professor&nbsp;<a href="http://geography.vt.edu/people/boyer.htm">John Boyer&rsquo;s massive (offline) World Regions class</a>.</li>
<li>"<strong>Online</strong>&rdquo;: This is self-explanatory, right? This is what distinguishes a MOOC from the example above. But even here I wonder if we need a subscript or something to indicate that there are also offline versions &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re the official, for-credit courses on campus (See: DS106) or they&rsquo;re informal study groups.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Open&rdquo;</strong>: This is the worm-hole of meaning. Open enrollment? Openly licensed content? An open-source tech platform? Open-ended classes? Open transparency on the university (or startup) offering it about their mission and their trajectory?</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Course&rdquo;</strong>: C is for cookie. C is for course. C also stands for connection, connectivism, community, credit, and/or certificate. Take your pick. But whichever you choose as the C in MOOC shapes greatly the MOOC itself, I&rsquo;d argue.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://edtechdev.wordpress.com/2012/05/04/whats-the-problem-with-moocs/">Doug Holton</a>&nbsp;has suggested other acronyms: MOOLE, for example. A massively open online learning environment. He points to MMORPG too (that is: massively multiplayer online role playing game) as an alternative to how we frame the MOOC.</p>
<p>All this is helpful for my thinking about MOOCs as a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; -- a phenomenon and/or an instructional and/or connectivist model. But it does little to help me as a writer and user of acronyms. I still need to do a better job distinguishing connectivist MOOCs from the Stanford model without each blog post going into details about what I mean by that. I suppose that&rsquo;s what footnotes and links are for &ndash; where references are necessary. But I don&rsquo;t know. Does that turn every MOOC-related story into a historical treatise?</p>
<p>As for me, from here on out, maybe I&rsquo;ll just use the domain&nbsp;<a href="http://mooc.ca/">MOOC.ca</a>&nbsp;to refer to MOOC&rsquo;s connectivist origins &ndash; a top-level-domain homage to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course#History">Canadians involved</a>. (Which means, yes, Stephen Downes.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/58330">You do need to update that site</a>.)</p>
<p>But there must be other acronyms and better word choices. Chime in, please.</p>
