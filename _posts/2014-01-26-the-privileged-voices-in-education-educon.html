<p>I can&rsquo;t really remember the particular event that prompted me to send a message to my friend <a href="http://thejosevilson.com/">Jos&eacute; Vilson</a>, saying &ldquo;We need to propose an <a href="http://educonphilly.org/">Educon</a> session on &lsquo;privilege.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might have been someone in a position of power in education arguing that &ldquo;others&rdquo; just need to learn to be more like them &ndash; or just have more &ldquo;grit.&rdquo; It might have been one of a zillion lists of &ldquo;The Top&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Best&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Most Influential&rdquo; in education that fail to recognize a single person of color. It might have been discussions about &ldquo;genius&rdquo; or &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; or &ldquo;success&rdquo; in which these things are defined in such a way that, for most of us, these labels are unattainable &ndash; no matter how much we &ldquo;lean in&rdquo; &ndash; because these things are <em>structurally</em> unattainable. It might have been the bullshit we hear nevertheless about meritocracy. It might have been the bullshit we hear about revolution and resistance &ndash; about who should speak up and speak out. It might have been a story in the news. A blog post. A tweet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really remember the particular event that prompted me to send a message to Jos&eacute; saying &ldquo;We need to propose an Educon session on &lsquo;privilege.&rsquo;&rdquo; And see, that&rsquo;s the thing. It could have been one of a million things.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m not sure Jos&eacute; was thrilled with my idea. And I get that. This work is exhausting. This conversation, dangerous. There can be consequences &ndash; material consequences &ndash; when folks speak up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become increasingly frustrated with Twitter, I admit, as a site where we do this work. Too fast. Too decontextualized. Too little nuance. I mean, I love Twitter, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>I thought Educon would be a good place to have this discussion: a small event for (largely) progressive educators. But (historically), it&rsquo;s been a pretty white event. While Educon is held at Science Leadership Academy, a majority minority urban high school in the heart of Philly, many attendees work at independent schools throughout New England. So yeah. Privilege.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s conversation &ndash; &ldquo;The Privileged Voices in Education&rdquo; &ndash; went well. Better than I expected. (I should note: sessions at Educon are supposed to be &ldquo;conversations&rdquo; &ndash; not lectures, not presentations.) We hoped to open a conversation, and I think we did that. The group talked about privilege and micro-aggressions and anger and humility and vulnerability.</p>
<p>A huge thanks to Jos&eacute;, whose ferocity and wisdom I admire endlessly. And thanks to all those who attended. (I gathered some of the tweets below. There&rsquo;s also a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vxj93zvA9mMZIV_pqxizN9W9pezNiFl0uokxbUuLqvE/edit?usp=sharing">Google Doc</a> with a few resources on the topic.)</p>
