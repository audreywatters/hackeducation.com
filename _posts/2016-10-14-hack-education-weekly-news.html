<blockquote>
<p>Ed tech startups faced a chilly investment environment earlier this year, with deal count dropping to a four-year low in Q1&#8217;16. However, the sector began to recover in Q2, and stabilized in Q3 with a comparable deal count and slight funding growth compared to the previous quarter.</p>
<br />
<p>Still, even if ed tech funding continues at its current pace, 2016 will snap the sector&#8217;s four-year growth streak with drops in both deal count and investment dollars.</p>
