<p>Hackety-Hack is an app designed to teach complete beginners how to program in Ruby.  The step-by-step guide walks you through some on the basics of the Ruby language, as well as some basic Shoes, a Ruby toolkit that lets you build graphical interfaces.  In addition to lessons, there are other code samples, and you can upload your code to the website where there's also a Q&amp;A section.  It's all designed to get you ready to build your own apps.</p>
