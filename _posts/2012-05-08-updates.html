<p>A couple of quick updates:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been maintaining a <a href="http://hackeducation.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> site for some time now, where I&rsquo;d post links to various ed-tech blogs, education-related stories and videos. I had a little sidebar on the right hand side of this site where I ran the Tumblr feed. The idea was for you to click through to others&rsquo; stories. Turns out the links were broken.</p>
<p>Quite few things on this site were broken. The &ldquo;search box,&rdquo; for one. (I deleted that. Try appending &ldquo;site:hackeducation.com&rdquo; to the beginning of your search string if you&rsquo;re looking for something.) The archives menu never worked. (So I deleted that too). The RSS feed from my Tumblr account didn&rsquo;t work either apparently. Ah, the blessing and the curse of running your own website.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t fix the Tumblr RSS. In fact, I&rsquo;ve opted to abandon Tumblr altogether &ndash; <a href="http://smarterware.org/8026/why-not-tumblr">avoid data lock-in by avoiding Tumblr</a>, ya dig &ndash; and bring the act of curating and commenting on other blog posts back here to this site.</p>
<p>To that end, I&rsquo;ve added a new section to Hack Education. You&rsquo;ll find it via the "Other News" tab above (scroll up!) or via&nbsp;<a href="/news">hackeducation.com/news</a>.&nbsp;There you&rsquo;ll find me doing the same thing I did on over Tumblr &ndash; mostly posting the links to the articles I find most interesting, with a few words about why that&rsquo;s so. You can subscribe to the RSS feed <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/hackeducation/jAgy">here</a>. (It&rsquo;s a separate feed from the Hack Education blog posts, but I&rsquo;ll probably make the <a href="http://twitter.com/hackeducation">Hack Education Twitter account</a> become a firehose for all of this.)</p>
<p>These changes to Hack Education were inspired by <a href="http://downes.ca/">Stephen Downes&rsquo;s OLDaily</a> and <a href="http://grsshopper.downes.ca/">gRSShopper</a>. But consider all this on my site a beta. Let me know what works and doesn&rsquo;t work &ndash; in terms of form and content. I&rsquo;m not fully satisfied with it yet (the posts don&rsquo;t include authors&rsquo; names, for example), and I&rsquo;ll probably tweak things a lot over the coming days and weeks. Feedback wanted.</p>
