<h2 id="politicsandpolicies">Politics and Policies</h2>
<p>The <strong>University of Virginia</strong> has become the frontline of the battle for control over public education this week, as the fallout and outrage over the Board of Visitors&rsquo; firing of President Theresa Sullivan continues. In <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/20/e-mails-show-uva-board-wanted-big-online-push">FOIA-ed emails</a>, it appears as though the BOV read a couple of op-eds from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/opinion/brooks-the-campus-tsunami.html">David Brooks</a> and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304019404577416631206583286.html">John Chubb</a> and decided that if the school didn&rsquo;t jump on board the MOOC train right now that the &ldquo;campus tsunami&rdquo; was apparently going to destroy them all. Instead, it looks like they&rsquo;ve done their best to destroy a public university. Good job! (And it&rsquo;s worth noting that the &ldquo;job&rdquo; here is a result of being a <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/07/mcdonnell_appoints_supporters.html">political appointee a.k.a. big donor</a> of Virginia governor Bob McDonnell).</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been hailing the for-profit <a href="http://www.fullsail.edu/">Full Sail University</a> as an example of a school that has managed to keep college costs under control. But according to a new site launched by the Department of Education this week, the <strong><a href="http://collegecost.ed.gov/catc/">College Affordability &amp; Transparency Center</a></strong>, Full Sail University has the third highest net price for for-profit 4-year schools and is more expensive than public or private non-profit universities.</p>
<p>Attorneys-General in 15 states are <a href="http://californiawatch.org/node/16430">investigating</a> QuinStreet a California-based marketing firm that&rsquo;s matching for-profit universities with military veterans who have <strong>GI Bill</strong> benefits to spend. The company runs the site GIBill.com and is being accused of misleading vets into thinking that it&rsquo;s actually a governmental agency.</p>
<p>American education is failing, says the<strong> <a href="http://collegeboard.com">College Board</a></strong> (which as I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/04/28/the-week-in-ed-tech-news-the-launch-of-ted-ed-diy-and-google-drive/">noted in the past</a> profits handily on testing students, so I guess it would know, right?). To help draw attention to the problem, it&rsquo;s launched a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.dontforgeted.org/">Don&rsquo;t Forget about Ed</a>&rdquo; campaign, timed with the Presidential election. It installed some 857 desks on the National Mall this week to highlight the number of students who drop out of high school every hour.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/15/hack-education-weekly-news/">Last week</a>, there were indications that Jeff Bezos and Hillary Clinton were poised to announce a <strong>Kindle Learning Initiative</strong>. But the event at the State Department was cancelled, and no word given as to why. Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.infodocket.com/2012/06/18/national-federation-of-the-blind-tells-secretary-of-state-clinton-that-kindle-does-not-meet-needs-of-the-blindprint-disabled/">National Federation of the Blind</a> has sent a letter to the Secretary of State pointing out that the Kindle does not meet the needs of the blind or print disabled. &ldquo;It is no excuse that a vendor has not made its product accessible.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="legalities">Legalities</h2>
<p>The <strong>Minnesota Supreme Court</strong> has upheld a ruling that says that students can be punished for their Facebook posts. In the unanimous decision, it said that it wasn&rsquo;t saying that public universities can regulate students&rsquo; personal expression, but it found in this case that the student in question had violated &ldquo;academic program rules that are narrowly tailored and directly related to established professional conduct standards.&rdquo; The student in question was part of the University of Minnesota&rsquo;s mortuary program and had posted to Facebook statements about her playing with cadavers. (Um, isn&rsquo;t that the problem more than Facebook status updates? I&rsquo;m no lawyer, but still&hellip;) <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/132433/">The Chronicle</a> has more details.</p>
<h2 id="launches">Launches</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s the time for summer blockbusters, and among them let there be <strong><a href="http://mathhombre.blogspot.com/2012/06/mystery-teacher-theatre-2000.html">MTT2K</a></strong>, not to be confused &ndash; or only slightly confused with <a href="http://www.mst3k.com/">MST3K</a> &ndash; Mystery Teacher Theatre 2000. This is actually the work of hosts Dave Coffey and John Golden who, much like the MST3K antecedent, offer a running commentary as they watch math videos. Um, the running commentary is much like MST3K. The quality of the videos they&rsquo;re reviewing isn&rsquo;t the same. OR IS IT? Coffey and Golden watch and respond to Khan Academy videos, and it looks like their first episode, in which they find <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/edtechresearcher/2012/06/dont_use_khan_academy_without_watching_mmt2k_first.html">substantial flaws</a> with how Khan teaches the multiplication of negative numbers. <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=14299">Dan Meyer</a> points out that they really need better sound equipment. And Khan Academy has yanked the original video they analyze.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://launchpadtoys.com/">LaunchPad Toys</a></strong>, one of my picks for the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/18/top-10-ed-tech-startups-of-2011/">best education startups of 2011</a>, has launched its latest app, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id418451914">MonkeyGram</a>. &nbsp;Look for a review tomorrow!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reading-rainbow/id512350210?mt=8"><strong>Reading Rainbow</strong> app</a> has finally arrived on the iPad. It had its official launch this week, which resulted in lots of gushing stories from tech journalists who were <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/levar-burton-on-bringing-reading-rainbow-the-tv-show-of-your-childhood-to-the-tech-of-today/258740/">thrilled</a> to spend a little time with Levar Burton. And honestly, I would be too. But I would have asked him some tough questions about how the $9.99 per month subscription fee jives with what was once the encouragement for kids to find books in their public library (you know, that place where you can read for free).</p>
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/u-of-utah-to-help-students-publish-video-games/37181">The Chronicle</a> covers the launch of Heroes of Hat!, the first game released by <strong><a href="http://www.utahgameforge.com/">Utah Game Forge</a></strong>, a University of Utah owned and operated company that helps students bring their video games to market. Bonus: students retain IP.</p>
<p>Not an official launch, but an official unveiling: <strong>Microsoft</strong> announced <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx">Surface</a>, its new tablet. One of the features that&rsquo;s caught people&rsquo;s attention is its cover/keyboard. Is this feature enough to help unseat Apple&rsquo;s domination of the tablet market? Price will be a key factor, but Microsoft <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/06/all-things-microsoft-forgot-mention-about-surface-tablet/53681/">did not reveal</a> how much the Surface will cost nor when it will be released. &ldquo;Coming soon,&rdquo; which wil be too late for schools making IT decisions for the 2012&ndash;13 school year.</p>
<p>The American Federation of Teachers has partnered with TSL Education (the British publisher of the weekly Times Educational Supplement) to release a lesson-plan sharing website: <strong><a href="http://sharemylesson.com/">sharemylesson.com</a></strong>. The site will offer free resources to teachers, and as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/us/teachers-union-to-open-lesson-sharing-web-site.html">The New York Times</a> cites a TSL executive saying, if teachers &ldquo;are here to share user-generated content, you can&rsquo;t turn that into a marketplace and think you can get away with it.&rdquo; Of course lots of sites do &ldquo;get away with it&rdquo; (what a striking way to frame that, eh?), including <a href="http://betterlesson.com/">BetterLesson,</a> and <a href="http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/">TeachersPayTeachers</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Wikiotics Foundation</strong> has launched an open education campaign to build the &ldquo;<a href="http://thelastlanguagetextbook.org/">Last Language Textbook</a>,&rdquo; the idea being to create free, openly-licensed, and Web-based resources to replace language-learning textbooks. The campaign will <a href="http://blog.wikiotics.net/2012/06/the-last-language-textbook/">start</a> with English-language-learning resources.</p>
<h2 id="updatesandupgrades">Updates and Upgrades</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the content on iTunesU for a while, but one of the things that it&rsquo;s definitely <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/look-new-itunes-u">lacked</a> is a social element. But now Stanford University&rsquo;s most popular iTunes U course, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/ipad-iphone-application-development/id473757255"><strong>iPad and iPhone Application Developmen</strong>t</a> will have that, thanks to a partnership between the university and <strong><a href="https://piazza.com/">Piazza</a></strong>, a social learning startup that lets students and teachers interact online, in real-time. Here&rsquo;s hoping more classes and more universities follow suit.</p>
<h2 id="closures">Closures</h2>
<p>In order to save money, <strong>Michigan State University</strong> will be <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/michigan-state-to-shut-down-thousands-of-alumni-e-mail-accounts-to-save-money/36969">closing thousands of alumni email accounts</a>. The school will no longer maintain the email accounts of students who graduated over 2 years ago, which means the end to the .edu domain for about 117,000 people.</p>
<p>After news that several of its teen users had been approached by child predators, sexually assaulted and raped, the flirting app <strong><a href="http://skout.com">Skout</a></strong> has shut down its teen community. Only those 18+ will be able to use the app. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2012/06/14/skout-grasps-for-answers-after-sex-predator-crisis/">The Wall Street Journal</a> takes a closer look at what happened at Skout, despite the startup having lots of precautions in place to prevent this sort of thing.</p>
<h2 id="researchanddata">Research and Data</h2>
<p><strong>Confidence in public schools</strong> has reached an all time low, finds <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/155258/Confidence-Public-Schools-New-Low.aspx">Gallup</a>. Just 29% of Americans say they have &ldquo;a great deal&rdquo; or &ldquo;quite a lot&rdquo; of confidence in them. It also found record low confidence in the news &ndash; 21% &ndash; who have been doing a bang-up job informing us about how schools are failing, am I right?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/sites/democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/files/documents/112/pdf/letters/Charter%20School%20SWD%20full%20report_%20June%202012.pdf">GAO</a> released a report this week comparing the ways in which charter schools and public schools address <strong>special needs students.</strong> The summary of its findings: about 11% of students enrolled in regular public schools were on special education plans in 2009&ndash;10, but just 8% of charter school students are. Cue the accusations that charter schools purposefully ignore or fail to enroll special education students. <a href="http://shankerblog.org/?p=6107">The Shanker Blog</a>, of course, has the best insight into the study and the stats.</p>
<p>Some interesting <a href="http://www.i-programmer.info/news/150-training-a-education/4372-mitx-the-fallout-rate.html">statistics</a> out of <strong><a href="http://mitx.mit.edu/">MITx</a></strong>, which recently wrapped up its first MOOC, 6.002x Circuits and Electronics: 154,763 students registered; 7,157 received certificates for passing the class. That&rsquo;s a 5% completion rate, compared to a 14% completion rate for Stanford&rsquo;s famous AI MOOC.</p>
<p>The Pew Center has released its latest <a href="http://libraries.pewinternet.org/2012/06/22/libraries-patrons-and-e-books/">report</a>, this one on <strong>libraries and e-books</strong>. It found, among other things, that 58% of all library card holders say they do not know if their library provides e-book lending services. There&rsquo;s a lot more in this report than this one statistic, but it certainly seems to indicate that the publishers&rsquo; claims that e-book lending at libraries is going to destroy their businesses is a wee bit of an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The results of a <a href="http://www.academicworkforce.org/survey.html">survey</a> about higher ed&rsquo;s <strong>adjunct workforce</strong>, undertaken by the Coalition on the Academic Workforce, have been released. And no big shocker here: the news is grim. half of those who answered the 2010 survey saying that their annual personal income is less than $35,000 and two-thirds saying that they make under $45,000. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/20/adjunct-survey-paints-bleak-portrait">Inside Higher Ed</a> has more details.</p>
<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a></strong> has raised $10 million. <a href="http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-deals/2012-06-19-codeacademy-raises-10m-sees-job-service-as-part-of-its-future/">Bloomberg reports</a> that the startup is considering offering career-matching services, helping companies find developers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://unow.com">UniversityNow</a></strong> has raised $17.5 million for its for-profit university. &nbsp;Read more from me about this school and its business model <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/21/unow-and-the-mythologies-of-higher-ed/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Gates Foundation</strong> <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/press-releases/Pages/breakthrough-learning-models-120619.aspx">announced</a> $9 million in grants to &ldquo;support breakthrough learning models in higher education.&rdquo; That includes $1 million to edX, because apparently the $30 million apiece from Harvard and MIT wasn&rsquo;t enough, eh?</p>
<p>A hearty congrats to <strong><a href="http://unglue.it/">GlueJar</a></strong> which has successfully unglued its first book, <em>Oral Literature in Africa</em>. The title will now be made available in an openly licensed digital format, thanks to GlueJar&rsquo;s crowdfunding platform, Unglue.it. (My post on the site&rsquo;s launch is <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/unglueit-crowdfunded-e-book-liberation-project">here</a>.)</p>
<p>This is actually an end-of-funding story: <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/university-michigan-indiana-university-pause-investment-sakai-oae/">Phil Hill analyzes</a> the University of Michigan and Indiana University&rsquo;s decision to pause their investments in the open source LMS, the <a href="http://www.sakaiproject.org/welcome-sakai-oae">Sakai Open Academic Environment</a>. While Hill argues that, on the surface at least, the decision won&rsquo;t change much, he does wonder what the future holds for <strong>Sakai Project</strong>.</p>
