<p>Don't get me wrong.  I love my iPhone.  I love the apps.  And I think that putting powerful mobile computing device like that in the hands of as many people as possible has the power to really transform teaching and learning, in ways that 1-to-1 laptop initiatives have yet been unable to achieve.</p>
<p>But that being said, I often feel like we spend too much time swooning at the beauty and power of the smartphone and not enough time developing tools that work on the old clam-shell phone, <em>particularly when it comes to educational apps</em>.</p>
<p>Facebook gets it.  The social networking giant announced this week that it was releasing an app aimed at <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_releases_mobile_app_for_feature_phones.php">feature phones</a>, "to bring Facebook to the most popular mobile phones around the world."  Of course Facebook gets it though.  The company is on a quest to make us all users of the site.</p>
<p>So how can we translate this to the educational sector?</p>
<p>One way, obviously, is through building sites that are mobile-friendly and aren't reliant on the Android or iPhone app market.</p>
<p>Another way:  build tools that utilize SMS.</p>
<h2>Twilio Meetup at Knewton HQ:  Texting and Education</h2>
<p>In the rush to build cool apps, I think we often overlook text-messaging.  Our students don't.  They send <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/mobile/2010/10/teens-still-love-texting-but-mobile-app-use-growing.php">thousands of texts</a> a month.  As such, I'm always on the look out for innovative uses of text-messaging, as I really think there's tons of opportunities here to build cool tools.</p>
<p>Many developers working on building services that use telephony -- making and receiving calls and text-messages -- turn to <a href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a>, a company that offers these as part of its API.  For its part, Twilio does a great job supporting the developer community, with meetups and contests (not to mention an awesome team and product).</p>
<p>Recently, Twilio held a <a href="http://blog.twilio.com/2011/01/sms-door-locks-humans-vs-zombies-and-test-prep-at-twilio-meetup-nyc.html">meetup</a> in New York at the headquarters of the test-prep company <a href="http://www.knewton.com">Knewton</a>, and no surprise some pretty interesting projects were showcased, several of which were built by the Knewton folks and had an educational event.</p>
<p>(But I'm rather partial to the one built by <a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/">Flat World Knowledge</a> developer and Stony Brook student Jonathan Gottfried who built a <a href="http://www.twilio.com/gallery/apps/Stony-Brook-Hvz">notification system</a> for the university's <a href="http://www.stonybrookhvz.org/">Humans v Zombies</a> game.)</p>
<p>One of the many <a href="http://www.quora.com/Education/Should-cellular-phone-use-be-forbidden-in-high-schools-Why-or-why-not">critiques</a> of efforts to allow cellphones in the classroom as expressly educational devices is that it will simply enable most students to have access to the simplest of polling and quizzing tools.</p>
<p>My response:  then build better tools.</p>
