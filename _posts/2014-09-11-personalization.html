<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This post first appeared on <a href="http://modernlearners.com/the-problem-with-personalization/">Educating Modern Learners</a></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You keep using that word,&rdquo; says Inigo Montoya. &ldquo;I do not think it means what you think it means.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I always think of this line from the 1987 classic movie <em>The Princess Bride</em> when I hear talk of &ldquo;personalized learning.&rdquo; On one hand, "personalized  learning" sounds pretty good: a nod towards more student-centered  learning perhaps, a move that honors the person learning not just the  learning institution. But on the other hand, <em>I do not think it means what you think it means</em>.  Often, what I see the term applied to gives me pause &ndash; &ldquo;personalized  learning&rdquo; appears to be more focused on the scripting than on the  student. Personalized learning isn't personal learning.</p>
<h2>What <em>do</em> we mean by &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; in education and in ed-tech?</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s  the $1 million question, heck, the multimillion dollar question. We&rsquo;re  seeing hundreds of millions of dollars funneled into  education/technology companies that promise tools to &ldquo;personalize&rdquo; and  &ldquo;customize&rdquo; education for individual students, &ldquo;adapting&rdquo; to their  individual skills and needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personalization&rdquo;  can be used to describe a variety of educational programs &ndash; different  instructional approaches and different software and services. For many  the term has become a rallying cry to challenge the &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo;  model of the traditional education system. Fair enough.</p>
<p>But  &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t (necessarily) seem to challenge the goals or  the curriculum of traditional education. Instead, it promises to move  students towards those goals more effectively, more efficiently.</p>
<p>The promise of &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; is closely tied to <a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-should-school-leaders-know-about-adaptive-learning/">the promise of adaptive learning technology</a>.  Thanks to the data that students generate through their  computer-mediated work, we&rsquo;ll be able to better track each individual  student&rsquo;s progress. Moreover, with their data in aggregate, we&rsquo;ll be  able to design algorithms and from there software to deliver content  aimed at each individual student&rsquo;s appropriate skill level.</p>
<p>Thanks  to data and to technology, we&rsquo;ll finally be able to understand what  each individual student knows, what each individual student lacks, what  each individual students wants, and so on. Something &ndash; if you believe  the marketing &ndash; we&rsquo;ve never been able to do before.</p>
<p>And, ah, the marketing.</p>
<h2>How &ldquo;Personalization&rdquo; Gets Sold to Schools</h2>
<p>This  is one of my favorite slides from a venture capitalist highlighting the  transformations that technologies will break to the public school  system:</p>
<p>It comes from NewSchool Venture Fund&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Future of K&ndash;12 Education&rdquo; <a href="http://www.newschools.org/blog/reimagined">slideshow</a>, and it features their investment portfolio company No Red Ink which promises personalized digital grammar worksheets.</p>
<p>Here  the investment firm praises products that seek to &ldquo;reimagine engagement  through personalized content&rdquo; with &ldquo;problems based on personal interest  and real-world applications.&rdquo; But look at the example. How many kids in  middle school today struggling with punctuation would feel so much  closer to a &ldquo;deep learning&rdquo; of commas because of a reference to John  Mellencamp, who had his breakout hit &ldquo;Hurt So Good&rdquo; in 1982, long before  any kid in K&ndash;12 school today was born? <em>How is this personalized?</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another promise &mdash; one that&rsquo;s less about &ldquo;the past&rdquo; and more about &ldquo;the future&rdquo;:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If  you learn concept No. 513 best in the morning between 8:20 and 9:35  with 80 percent text and 20 percent rich media and no more than 32  minutes at a time, well, then the odds are you&rsquo;re going to learn every  one of 12 highly correlated concepts best that same way.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2013/07/10/what-if-you-could-learn-everything-237660.html">That&rsquo;s a quote from Knewton CEO Jose Ferreira</a>.  Knewton, initially a test prep company, now is one of the leading  promoters and producers of &ldquo;adaptive learning&rdquo; technology &mdash; the idea  that data collection and data analysis at scale will lead to  &ldquo;personalization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knewton has partnered with most of the major  textbook publishers &mdash; Pearson (which is also an investor in the  company), Cengage, Macmillan, Wiley, and so on &mdash; to deliver textbook  content and assessments through its platform.</p>
<p>Knewton creates an  inventory of all the concepts and skills in a particular textbook or  course, then by analyzing a student&rsquo;s clicks and running these through  its proprietary algorithms, Knewton then recommends what the student  should click on next &mdash; &ldquo;learn&rdquo; is the verb the company uses &mdash; to  maximize her or his speed and success in moving through the course  material.</p>
<p>"Depending on your learning style, it might be best to  introduce linear equations through a visual, geometric approach, where  you plot the lines and show the intersection.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/07/qa-with-knewtons-david-kuntz-maker-of-algorithms-that-replace-some-teacher-work/">That&rsquo;s a quote from Knewton&rsquo;s VP of research</a>.</p>
<p>Knewton has raised over <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/knewton">$105 million in venture capital</a>.  There&rsquo;s no shortage of cash there to hire some of the leading minds in  cognitive science research. So it&rsquo;s a bit disconcerting to see the  company&rsquo;s VP of research point to &ldquo;your learning style&rdquo; here. While  &ldquo;learning styles&rdquo; are a popular concept, <a href="http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back+Issues/September-October+2010/the-myth-of-learning-full.html">there&rsquo;s no scientific evidence supporting the idea</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Knewton&rsquo;s CEO recently wrote <a href="http://www.knewton.com/blog/ceo-jose-ferreira/rebooting-learning-styles/">a blog post</a> doubling down on this idea. &ldquo;To me,&rdquo; Ferreira insisted, &rdquo;it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that different learning styles exist.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s New About &ldquo;Personalization&rdquo;: Big Data</h2>
<p>The  phrase "To me it&rsquo;s pretty obvious&rdquo; does actually not reflect how  science works, despite the fact that what Knewton and others promise is  that &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; via adaptive technologies is based on science.  What &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; is based upon is data to be sure. Knewton says it  collects more than a million data points for each student over the  course of a semester. These data points are used to build and refine its  algorithms, and in turn this data is used to identify how well students  fit into certain models, certain profiles.</p>
<p>The content remains  standardized. The goals remain standardized. (These are goals of the  educator or administrator typically &mdash; not the goals of the student.) The  metrics remain standardized. &ldquo;Personalization&rdquo; is a simply a matter of  how the technology optimizes a students path through the  standardization.</p>
<h2>Personal Learning versus Personalized Learning</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s  never what educators, specifically progressive educators, have meant  when we have demanded that education be more personal, more  student-centered. Personalization, framed in this regard, means  empowering students to pursue their own interests, to follow their  curiosity, to build their knowledge and carve their learning paths &mdash; to  do so not through computer algorithms but through human agency.</p>
<p>Personalization,  when it comes to something like &ldquo;universal design for learning&rdquo; for  example &mdash; a concept that comes out of universities&rsquo; education  departments and not out of corporate marketing departments, recognizes  the need for flexibility when it comes to how we approach each student.  UDL means expanding and accommodating students &mdash; recognizing  differences, honoring differences. It doesn&rsquo;t mean matching students to  different profiles and funneling them through pre-ordained and  standardized processes. It means seeing students as different people and  supporting them as such.</p>
<p><em>What are the repercussions of radically &ldquo;personalizing&rdquo; education through computers? What do we gain? What do we lose?</em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s  a very powerful strain of American individualism &mdash; and California  exceptionalism &mdash; that permeates technology: an emphasis on personal  responsibility, self-management, autonomy. All that sounds great when  and if you frame new technologies in terms of self-directed learning.</p>
<p>But  how do we reconcile that individualism with the social and political  and community development that schools are also supposed to support? How  do we address these strains of individualism and increasingly  libertarianism as they permeate the classroom?</p>
<p>What do we do about  the communal goals of education, for example &mdash; to produce good  citizens, if nothing else &mdash; if we become maniacally focused on personal  goals of education instead? What happens to meaningful moments to  collaborate? What happens to discussion? What happens to debate? What  happens to the idea that we must work through ideas together &mdash; not just  in the classroom, but as part of our work and civic responsibilities?</p>
<p>And  who gets the &ldquo;personalized&rdquo; education delivered through them via  adaptive technology? And who gets the &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; that we hope a  student-centered, progressive education would offer?</p>
<p>This image from <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/education-july-dec12-rocket_12-28/">a PBS documentary about Rocketship Education</a> haunts me.</p>
<p>The  chain of charter schools boasts personalization &mdash; "Rocketship uses the  most adaptive and personalized programs available, and continues to push  Silicon Valley vendors and others to create even more adaptive learning  tools,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.rsed.org/">its website boasts</a>.</p>
<p>So the problem with personalization via adaptive software isn&rsquo;t simply that &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s that it <em>might</em> work &mdash; work to obliterate meaningful and powerful opportunities for  civics, for connection, for community. Work to obliterate agency for  students. And work not so much to accelerate learning, but to accelerate  educational inequalities.</p>
