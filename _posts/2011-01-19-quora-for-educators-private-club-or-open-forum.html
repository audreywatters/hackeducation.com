<p>Back in September. I wrote a <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/09/06/ed-tech-qa-on-quora/">post</a> urging educators to join the Q&amp;A site <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a>.  Looking back at that post now, it's sort of funny.  In it, I make a case for teachers joining a site that at the time, few people in education circles had heard of, suggesting they do so in order to add their voices to a site that was dominated by bleeding edge tech, Silicon Valley folks.</p>
<p>Since I wrote that post, Quora has <a href="http://blog.sysomos.com/2011/01/06/how-did-quora-get-so-popular-so-fast/">exploded</a> in popularity, something credited in part to the famous Scoble effect when tech evangelist Robert Scoble joined the site over the holidays.</p>
<p>But what strikes me as funny about this three-month old post isn't that everyone's now on Quora.  Despite what's been a massive growth spurt for Quora, it's still a rather closed circle.  In some ways, I think, people would argue that's a good thing as it's what's keeping the quality of the Q&amp;A high.  But on the other hand, it means that both the questions and the answers really only represent a small piece of inquiry and expertise.</p>
<p>I've been watching the education-related questions with some interest, and I would love to hear from educators who are using the site.  (How long have you been a member of Quora?  How are you using it?  Are you finding it useful?)</p>
<p>As you can see with the spat below between investor Keith Rabois and professor Vivek Wadhwa, it's a contentious issue -- one that I've decided to <a href="http://www.storify.com">Storify</a> not just because it's a decent Twitter fight but because in those 2 figures you have a voice of the Valley (Rabois) and a voice of education (Wadhwa).</p>
