<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p><strong>0:00</strong>: &nbsp;Steve sings <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/05/hack-education-turns-2/">"Happy Birthday" to Hack Education</a>, and we discuss two years of blogging here on this site -- what trends can be gleaned from the tag cloud?</p>
<p><strong>3:55</strong>: &nbsp;How might Facebook's rumored plans to allow those under-13 to join the site prompt us to reconsider what's working and <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/04/will-facebook-help-us-rethink-coppa/">not working with COPPA</a>? &nbsp;Who (whose data) needs protection online? &nbsp;How might Facebook (and other companies too, like Google) lobby the government around this issue?</p>
<p><strong>15:09</strong>: MOOCs -- <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/07/the-language-of-moocs/">word origins</a> and <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/04/mooc-infrastructure/">technology infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p><strong>38:15:</strong> &nbsp;My test-drive of the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/08/hands-on-with-the-new-google-chromebook/">new Chromebook</a>.</p>
<p><strong>40:00:</strong> &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/06/08/hack-education-weekly-news--ray-bradbury-and-the-venus-transit/">weekly news round-up</a>, including vouchers in Lousiana, a pay-per-performance textbook model, and a fundraiser for Science Leadership Academy.</p>
