<p>As far as ed-tech trends go, 2011 was <em>not</em> the year of the e-textbook.</p>
<h3>Hooray E-Books</h3>
<br />
<p>True, e-books in general have racked up record sales this year, outselling print for the first time, not just <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/technology/20amazon.html">at Amazon</a> but <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/e-book_sales_surpass_print_is_this_a_win_or_a_loss.php">across the entire industry</a>. 2011 was also the year Borders declared bankruptcy and closed its bookstores -- the end to a brick-and-mortar retail giant which had invested so heavily in all sorts of physical media (CDs, movies, and books) that have now gone digital.</p>

<h3>Boo Textbooks</h3>
<br />
<p>If there's one form of physical media book with bonus CD-ROM book that's despised, it has to be the textbook, right? Textbooks are heavy. They're expensive. They're boring.</p>

But when it came to the actual adoption of e-textbooks? An actual <em>trend</em>? Well, not so much.  Not <em>quite</em> yet.</p>
