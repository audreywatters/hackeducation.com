<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week. And I have to admit, after writing three posts last week about the business and politics of ed-tech (<a href="/2012/10/08/alec-and-ed-tech/">ALEC</a>, <a href="/2012/10/10/ed-tech-investors/">investors</a>, <a href="/2012/10/11/profits-and-lies/">profit motives, and innovation</a>), I was really eager to have our weekly conversation.</p>
<p>Hopefully you'll find it as thought-provoking a discussion as I did.</p>
