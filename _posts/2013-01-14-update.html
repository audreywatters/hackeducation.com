<p>Today I counted the number of posts I&rsquo;ve written on Hack Education since January 1: only 7. I&rsquo;m on track &mdash; well, as of Week 2 of 2013, ha ha ha&nbsp;&mdash; to blog here half as often as I did in 2012.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m writing a book. (More details to come&hellip;)</p>
<p>It's likely I will be updating Hack Education less frequently throughout (if not the year then) the duration of this book-writing process. Yes, of course, I&rsquo;ll still be blogging here. This remains the site where I write and rant about education. Duh.</p>
<p>But in case there are periods of extended silence here, in case you're curious: here&rsquo;s a list of the other places where you&rsquo;ll be able to track me (and track what I&rsquo;m tracking&hellip;)</p>
<p><strong>News Elsewhere:</strong>&nbsp;A subsection of this blog. When I read smart, interesting, relevant education technology stuff, I share it &mdash; with just a bit of commentary &mdash; <a href="/news/">here</a>. Or follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/hackedunewstick">Hack Education News Ticker on Twitte</a>r.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly News:</strong> I&rsquo;ll continue to post every Friday my <a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=weekly%20roundup">roundup</a> of all the education technology news of the week.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletter:</strong> I send a weekly email newsletter (And yes. I&rsquo;m sorry. Ugh. Email.) once a week. Sign up <a href="http://eepurl.com/l-yJz">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking:</strong> <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/audreywatters/">Find me</a> at EduCon, API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference, SXSWedu, and elsewhere&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Podcast:</strong> Steve Hargadon and I will continue to record our podcast (Schedule TBD).</p>
<p><strong>Tumblr:</strong> I don&rsquo;t update <a href="http://audreywatters.tumblr.com">my personal Tumblr blog</a> all that frequently. But I do use Tumblr to <a href="http://robotchronicles.tumblr.com">track links about robots</a> with maniacal regularity (That's a hint re: my book).</p>
<p><strong>Personal Blog:</strong> <a href="http://audreywatters.com">http://audreywatters.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Twitter:</strong> Your best bet for staying in touch: follow me on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>. (Twitter is a real-time communication network. Email is not. Use accordingly.)</p>
