<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-charter-20150922-story.html"><em>The LA Times</em>&#8217; Howard Blume broke a story</a> this week about the Broad Foundation&#8217;s &#8220;ambitious $490-million plan to place half of the city&#8217;s students into charter schools over the next eight years, a controversial gambit that backers hope will serve as a catalyst for the rest of the nation.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The document cites numerous foundations and individuals who could be tapped for funding. In addition to the Broad Foundation, the list includes the Gates, Bloomberg, Annenberg and Hewlett foundations. Among the billionaires cited as potential donors are Stewart and Lynda Resnick, major producers of mandarin oranges, pistachios and pomegranates; Irvine Co. head Donald Bren; entertainment mogul David Geffen; and Tesla Motors&#8217; Elon Musk.</p>

The former NBA star, now mayor of Sacramento, California and husband to former DC schools chancellor Michelle Rhee, is &#8220;just the sort of politician a lot of people want to believe, and a lot of people have done so.&#8221; Johnson has weathered several scandals. The latest &#8220;involves the mayor replacing civil servants with private citizens funded by the Wal-Mart empire and tasked with the twin purposes of working to abolish public education and bring in piles of cash for Kevin Johnson.&#8221; (The <em>latest</em> latest: &#8220;<a href="http://deadspin.com/im-a-grown-up-now-the-teen-who-accused-kevin-johnson-1732538782">&#8216;I&#8217;m A Grown-Up Now&#8217;: The Teen Who Accused Kevin Johnson Of Sexual Abuse Speaks Out</a>.&#8221;)</p>
