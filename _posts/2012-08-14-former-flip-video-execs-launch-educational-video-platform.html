<p>Long before the buzz about the &ldquo;flipped classroom,&rdquo; there was buzz about the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_Video">Flip camera</a>,&rdquo; a low-cost but good-quality, easy-to-use video camera. Teachers and students loved it. But the company behind the camera, Pure Digital Technologies, was acquired by Cisco 2009 and production was halted in 2011.</p>
<p>Today, two of the executives behind the Flip Camera are unveiling their latest venture, <a href="http://knowmia.com">Knowmia</a>, a collection of &ldquo;crowdsourced video lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of this is a pretty familiar narrative in Silicon Valley: entrepreneurs found a startup that gets acquired; the company that buys the startup doesn&rsquo;t simply absorb the technology or employees, but actually shuts their product(s) down; the entrepreneurs leave the company and found another startup in turn. And increasingly, the narrative includes something along the lines of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a parent now, and I want to do something to improve education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one hand, Knowmia&rsquo;s founders Ariel Braunstein and Scott Kabat may be well positioned since the branding of their former company&rsquo;s feature product coincides so neatly with one of the hottest trends in education right now. But there seem to be a lot of challenges ahead too &ndash; and not simply because consumer hardware guys and moving into educational software.</p>
<p>And specifically, moving into educational video where there are lots of offerings already &ndash; vast video libraries on YouTube, as well as other sites that offer online lessons (video or otherwise). Knowmia is pulling some of this content into its site &ndash; it currently touts about 7000 videos &ndash; and hopes to employ a teacher-driven tagging system so that the content is more easily discoverable. (Pity this doesn&rsquo;t tap into the <a href="http://www.learningregistry.org/">Learning Registry</a> or the <a href="http://www.lrmi.net/">LMRI</a> &ndash; although it&rsquo;s not too late to do so!)</p>
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/screenshot-knowmia-2.jpeg" alt="" align="right" />Knowmia will also host videos, a move that might assuage the fears of some schools that YouTube doesn&rsquo;t just serve up quality video content, but serves up advertising as well as sometimes inappropriate related videos (although not so much with its new <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/12/youtube-for-schools-versus-schools-web-filters/">YouTube for Schools</a> channel).</p>
<p>The startup, which is part of the latest batch of <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> companies, says it plans to &ldquo;add value&rdquo; to these videos by creating mini-courses &ndash; that is, having teachers in certain fields frame recommended viewing lists, as well as add other elements like assessments. The company also has an iPad app (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/teach/id527216211?mt=8">iTunes link</a>) so that teachers (or anyone really) can create their own lessons to share on the Knowmia site.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;certain &lsquo;magic&rsquo; that happens when a teacher and student match in style,&rdquo; co-founder Ariel Braunstein told me, &ldquo;when that teacher can explain things to a student that no one else can.&rdquo; The point of Knowmia, he argues, is to be able to present a wide-range of video lessons on a topic so that students can decide what to watch based not just on content, but on teachers&rsquo; presentation styles.</p>
<p>That stance certainly suggests that this is a consumer-oriented play and not (necessarily) a school-focused one. Braunstein says that Knowmia sees itself as a &ldquo;supplemental education&rdquo; tool and is chasing a piece of the tutoring market &ndash; currently at $54 billion in the US and expected to increase to about $100 billion in the next few years. But will parents want to buy video lessons for their children? Or will human tutors &ndash; on or offline &ndash; remain popular? How do classroom teachers fit into this model (and I mean that both pedagogically as well as economically)?</p>
<p>And will the &ldquo;flipped classroom&rdquo; become not just a buzzword for teachers rethinking how homework is done and how class-time is spent, but one that parents too start to embrace in lieu of traditional test prep and homework help?</p>
