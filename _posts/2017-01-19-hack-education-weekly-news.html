<p><em>I&#8217;m publishing this week&#8217;s Hack Education Weekly News a little early this week. I plan to be offline tomorrow, January 20, so as to avoid any news about the Trump Inauguration. I join Representative John Lewis in insisting Trump is an &#8220;<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/john-lewis-trump-won-t-be-legitimate-president-n706676">illegitimate President</a>.&#8221; Trump is illegitimate because of the Russian intervention in the election, and the Trump team&#8217;s close ties with Russia. Trump is illegitimate because he lost the popular vote by 3 million. Trump is illegitimate because of voter suppression in light of the Supreme Court&#8217;s dismantling of the Voting Rights Act. Trump is illegitimate because he refuses to divest from his business interests and as such will be in violation of the Constitution the minute he takes the oath of office. Trump is illegitimate because he has indicated nothing but disdain for the Constitution.</em></p>

<p><em>So I can&#8217;t watch or listen to the news tomorrow, as it&#8217;s a dark day for democracy &#8211; one of the darkest in my lifetime and perhaps even in this nation&#8217;s history. I&#8217;m heading out in the desert for a day or two, but when I return I will do everything in my power to resist the corporate fascism that Trump seems eager to usher in, with many in ed-tech cheering him all along the way.</em></p>
