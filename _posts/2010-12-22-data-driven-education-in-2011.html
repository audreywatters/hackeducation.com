<p>The writers at ReadWriteWeb are busy putting together our list of predictions for 2011; and without spoiling all my crystal-ball-gazing, I'll say that I think one of the major areas for tech innovation next year will be around "data science." I predict "data-driven" will be the next buzzword-adjective, joining the ranks of "social," "mobile," and "location."</p>
<h2>Data-Driven Education:  Promise and Problems</h2>
<p>But I must say, to me at least, "<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/08/22/the-data-driven-educator/">data-driven</a> education" sounds both incredibly promising and incredibly frightening. And I anticipate that 2011's embrace of data will have huge implications for education -- not all of which will be positive.</p>
<p>Of course, we've seen the demands for data in education for a long time now, with the push for standardized testing as the premier method for gauging student achievement. And now, we're seeing moves to use these test scores -- "data" -- to <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/12/03/the-year-in-ed-tech-part-1-us-politics/">measure teachers' performance</a> in turn.  Admittedly I am unconvinced that standardized test scores say all that much about student achievement, and so I tend to resist the idea that data we use to be "data-driven" is solely reliant on test scores.</p>
<p>That being said, I am a huge fan of data, open data, access to information.  I do believe we make better decisions when we are better informed.  And I think there is a wealth of data -- far beyond standardized test scores -- that we should look at in order to act and spend and educate wisely.</p>
<h2>Data First</h2>
<p>All of that is by way of rambling introduction to the new website <a href="http://www.data-first.org/">Data First</a>, a project of the Center for Public Education, funded by a grant from the Gates Foundation. The site says it aims to improve decision-making in education through data.  But its mission isn't exactly <em>providing</em> data.  Rather the site says it's designed to "guide people through the questions they should be asking about their schools, and point to the data sources that offer answers."</p>
<p>Here's some of the questions the site answers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>"Are our students ready for college":  A look at SAT scores</li>
<li>"What's the racial makeup of our school":  Department of Education data</li>
<li>"What is the poverty level of our school":  Based on free- and reduced-lunch programs</li>
<li>"How many students with disabilities are in our school":  Department of Education data</li>
<li>"How many students receive high school credentials":  Department of Education data</li>
<li>"What is our average class size?":  Data from the National Center for Education Statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>Undoubtedly, these are good questions to ask.  And the answers, good information to know.  I like it that this site explains how a lot of these calculations are made:  "proficiency," "improvement," "growth."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">None of it, however, assuages my fears that we're still looking at the wrong, or at least very incomplete, data.</p>
