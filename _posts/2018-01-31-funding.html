<p>When I post an article to Hack Education, it&#8217;s (typically) something I&#8217;ve thought about and researched and worked on for a while. But this site also has a number of subdomains where I am working on other research that isn&#8217;t necessarily accompanied by well-wrought prose or analysis.</p>

<p>I spent part of the day today updating the Ed-Tech Funding Project, for example, which lives at <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">funding.hackeducation.com</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2018/01/31/january">Here are the numbers for January</a>, for what it&#8217;s worth:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $336.8 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 20</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $16.8 million / Median investment size: $4.1 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 14</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 0</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Since 2015, I have been tracking in detail which companies are raising venture capital and from who. While, sure, you can find quarterly and annual reports from a variety of investment analysis firms that will give you the numbers, I wanted the details. I wanted to be able to play with the data, not just copy-and-paste someone else&#8217;s line graph tracking year-over-year investment patterns.</p>

<p>The Ed-Tech Funding Project has details about <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/investments.html">investments</a>, <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/acquisitions.html">acquisitions</a>, <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/mergers.html">mergers</a>, <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/ipos.html">IPOs</a>, and <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/spinoffs.html">spinoffs</a>, as well as &#8220;<a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/deadpool.html">the ed-tech startup dead pool</a>.&#8221; I also track <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html">who&#8217;s received Gates Foundation money</a> and <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/edsurge.html">who&#8217;s funding Edsurge</a> (and paying for content to appear on that site).</p>

<p>As part of my Spencer Education Fellowship, I am also looking in some detail at various investment firms &#8211; what they invest in as well as who works there &#8211; all in at attempt to understand how powerful networks operate in education technology (and education reform) and how the stories we are told about the future of education technology are shaped. If you visit another subdomain &#8211; <a href="http://data.hackeducation.com">data.hackeducation.com</a> &#8211; you can see some of that work-in-progress.</p>

<p>I update the Ed-Tech Funding Project once-a-month. There&#8217;s a blog attached to that project, and if you want to subscribe, there is <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/feed.xml">an RSS feed</a>. <a href="https://github.com/HackEducation/funding">The project is hosted on GitHub</a>, so the data is readily available to be downloaded, forked, re-used, scrutinized, etc.</p>
