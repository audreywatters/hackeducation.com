<h3>Presidential Campaign Politics <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/poop100.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>There was a <strong>Presidential debate</strong> this week. Thankfully, it was the last one. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/21/news/economy/wine-production-weather-climate-change/">There&#8217;s also a global wine shortage,</a> and I&#8217;m like, no shit. We are drinking so heavily to make it through this election.</p>

<p>News broke over the weekend that billionaire investor <strong>Peter Thiel</strong> is making <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html">a million-plus dollar donation</a> to the <strong>Trump campaign</strong>. Thiel spoke at the Republican Convention, but this is his first financial commitment to the campaign, one that comes on the heels of news that Trump has been accused by ten (or more?) women of groping and sexual assault.</p> 

<p>I wrote &#8220;an explainer&#8221; of sorts on Thiel and his politics, and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/10/16/thiel-trump-education-technology">I listed the education companies that he&#8217;s invested in</a>. Mostly <strong>surveillance</strong> posing as &#8220;<strong>personalization</strong>&#8221; startups. To be honest, think Thiel and his ed-tech politics have more in common with the rest of Silicon Valley than those that feign outrage at his support of Trump. <strong>Y Combinator</strong> (<a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/10/19/thiel-y-combinator">I list its education investments here</a>) has refused to sever ties with Thiel. He&#8217;s a partner there. So has <strong>Facebook</strong>. He&#8217;s on the board of directors. Some organizations have cut ties with Y Combinator over this &#8211; <a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/10/17/project-include-cuts-off-y-com.html"><strong>Project Include</strong>, for starters</a>, which works to address Silicon Valley&#8217;s lack of diversity.</p> 

<p>&#8220;Horrified by <strong>Trump</strong>, Silicon Valley Leaders Debate Cutting Ties to <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>&#8221; <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/horrified-by-trump-silicon-valley-leaders-debate-cutting-ties-to-peter-thiel">by Sarah Jeong</a>. The operative word is &#8220;debate.&#8221; More on how the rest of the tech sector is treating Thiel now, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/technology/how-silicon-valley-treats-a-trump-backer-peter-thiel.html">according to The New York Times at least</a>. &#8220;<strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> breaks his silence on Peter Thiel&#8221; says CNN. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/19/peter-thiel-support-donald-trump-mark-zuckerberg">The Guardian&#8217;s Julia Carrie Wong summarizes the comments</a>: &#8220;Zuckerberg: white male Facebook board member&#8217;s Trump support provides &#8216;diversity&#8217;.&#8221; Also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/peter-thiel-support-donald-trump-date-rape-book">via Wong</a>: &#8220;Peter Thiel once wrote a book calling <strong>date rape</strong> &#8216;belated regret&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thrilling that these are the folks bankrolling ed-tech, no? Have any ed-tech companies, particularly those funded by Thiel or Zuckerberg or Y Combinator, spoken out about this?</p>
