<br />
<p>Listen, folks (particularly educators). If you&#8217;re going to decry &#8220;<strong>fake news</strong>,&#8221; then you best not be sharing it. If you&#8217;re going to talk about the importance of digital literacy or information literacy or media literacy or what have you, then you best practice it. Did you share <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2017/11/education-officials-expect-ineffective-betsy-devos-to-step-down-as-her-agenda-collapses-report/">this Raw Story story</a> &#8211; &#8220;Education officials expect &#8216;ineffective&#8217; Betsy DeVos to step down as her agenda collapses: report&#8221; &#8211; or <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/11/06/officials-expect-devos-to-resign-from-trump-administration_partner/">this Salon story</a> &#8211; &#8220;Expert: Expect DeVos to resign from Trump administration&#8221;? Why? Did you read <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/01/betsy-devos-secretary-education-profile-2017-215768">the Politico profile</a> of <strong>Betsy DeVos</strong> that these (and many <a href="http://getschooled.blog.myajc.com/2017/11/06/hard-lessons-for-betsy-devos-will-she-stay-or-will-she-go/">other</a>) pieces of clickbait were based on? Did you see evidence in that well-reported story that a resignation was imminent? Or did you just want a story to confirm your gut feelings that she should hit the road? Because, see, that&#8217;s part of the whole problem. It&#8217;s not just that these stories get written. It&#8217;s that folks share them so quickly and uncritically. Anyway, <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/us/2017/11/07/no-theres-no-reason-to-think-devos-is-planning-to-resign-contrary-to-viral-news-stories/">as Matt Barnum writes</a>, &#8220;<strong>No, there’s no reason to think DeVos is planning to resign, contrary to viral news stories</strong>.&#8221;</p>
