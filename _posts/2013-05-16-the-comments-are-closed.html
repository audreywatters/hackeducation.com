<h2>No Comment</h2>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/fountainpen150.png" alt="" align="right" />I&rsquo;ve decided to no longer have comments on this blog. It&rsquo;s been something I&rsquo;ve been considering for a while now. Here&rsquo;s what <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2012/11/03/comments/">I wrote on my personal blog back in November</a> as I weighed the decision. I&rsquo;m copying it at length because my thoughts really haven&rsquo;t changed much since then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been debating lately whether I should ditch the comments on Hack Education. Just the thought makes me wince as it feels as though it&rsquo;s a move that runs contrary to much of my reasoning for writing online and in this blog format: I want to engage intellectually and openly with others. To remove comments would mute that engagement, sending the signal that I&rsquo;m not listening only writing.</p>
<p>Comments on the Internet are, of course, notoriously terrible. Exhibit A: YouTube, where even the sweetest of videos can elicit the vilest of responses.</p>
<p>The comments on Hack Education aren&rsquo;t YouTube-level bad at all, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I do get very thoughtful responses to my articles, and these responses in turn help me clarify my own arguments &mdash; just as I&rsquo;d hope they would by being part of a discourse community. Of course, commenters also point out when I&rsquo;ve made spelling or HTML errors &mdash; always nice to know. But some of the posts I&rsquo;ve written have resulted in some pretty awful comment threads. When I write critically about Khan Academy or Apple, I know I&rsquo;ll hear an earful &mdash; and it isn&rsquo;t simply an earful of disagreement. The comments get incredibly hostile, the attacks personal.</p>
<p>Often I dread seeing the email notifications from Disqus, the tool I use to host blog comments, informing me that someone has responded to what I&rsquo;ve written. (This isn&rsquo;t a fault of Disqus, I should clarify, as I do like how it handles profiles across multiple sites. I&rsquo;d never use Facebook comments as I think they&rsquo;re profoundly anti-privacy, unfriendly to teachers and anyone who works at a site where Facebook is blocked, and unsympathetic to anyone who wants to leave an anonymous comment.) If the email from Disqus tells me there&rsquo;s a comment related to a particularly controversial post, I often delete it without reading it. I don&rsquo;t visit Hack Education to read it either. And that&rsquo;s hardly engagement now, is it?</p>
<p>When I mentioned the other day on Twitter that I find the negative comments (and the personal attacks) to be exhausting, someone said I should just write less negative blog posts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha.</p>
<h2>No Community</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been blogging for a very, very long time now, and in doing so I have found incredible support online &mdash; found myself part of many intellectual, personal, and professional communities. But the &ldquo;community&rdquo; &mdash; that is, the commenters and my interactions with them &mdash; on my early personal blogs was quite different than what exists on most the technology blogs I&rsquo;ve since worked and written for. More often, it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;community&rdquo; at all.</p>
<p>And as Hack Education has gained a larger readership, the commenters have become more like the latter (like tech sites) than the former. Yet, Hack Education remains my personal (albeit education-focused) blog. It&rsquo;s just me here. No other staff. No &ldquo;social media editor.&rdquo; No &ldquo;community manager.&rdquo; That makes the comments &mdash; particularly the hostile ones &mdash; harder to deal with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become increasingly clear to me that I am not building any sort of community <em>through the comments on this site</em>. If nothing else, I just don&rsquo;t have the time (or the stomach) to moderate and respond. And <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/2011/dec/30/how-create-engaging-comments-section/">moderation of comments is absolutely necessary</a>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say I don&rsquo;t believe in engaging with my readers and my peers and my friends and my colleagues online. That&rsquo;s not to say I don&rsquo;t believe in engaging with my critics. That&rsquo;s not to say I&rsquo;m uninterested in hearing feedback (or copy-editing) on my stories. <em>But blog comments just aren&rsquo;t the place that this is happening.</em></p>
<p>This makes me sad.</p>
<p>When I wrote the blurb above back in November, I decided that &ldquo;the good&rdquo; of keeping comments outweighed &ldquo;the bad.&rdquo; But I can&rsquo;t maintain the argument any longer. Mostly, I can&rsquo;t maintain the comments.</p>
<p>Of course, you can still always send me an email. You can reply when I post a link to on Google+, App.net, LinkedIn, or Facebook. You can talk to me on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) &mdash; frankly, that&rsquo;s probably your best bet if as I&rsquo;m most active and &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; there. And if you have something more to say than 140-characters (roughly the length of oh so many comments), you can write your own article and post it on your own domain.</p>
