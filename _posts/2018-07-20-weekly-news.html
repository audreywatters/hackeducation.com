One note: Google Maps is not an &#8220;an open ecosystem for accurate, real-time geospatial and navigation data.&#8221; It&#8217;s a proprietary ecosystem, one that&#8217;s subsidized by advertising dollars, one that charges businesses to use its APIs, one that sucks data from municipalities but does not feel it has a civic responsibility to give data back to the public in return, and one that is increasingly <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/122083/pax-google-how-your-friendly-search-engine-took-over-world">shaping</a> how we understand geographic space.

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Many caregivers and policy makers consider Internet filters a useful technology for keeping young people safe online. Although this position might make intuitive sense, there is little empirical evidence that Internet filters provide an effective means to limit children&#8217;s and adolescents&#8217; exposure to online sexual material.&#8221; </p>
