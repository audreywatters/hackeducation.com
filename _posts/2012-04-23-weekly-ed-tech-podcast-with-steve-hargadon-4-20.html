<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>This week' podcast was a particularly impassioned one, what with talk of robot essay graders and with the tweets that came out of the Education Innovation Summit at ASU.</p>
<p><strong>0:24</strong>: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/04/14/udacity-cs101/">My review of Udacity's CS 101</a> (another "Incomplete" for Audrey)</p>
<p><strong>2:20</strong>: &nbsp;Institutional MOOCs -- Classes or community? &nbsp;Hierarchy or connections? &nbsp;What do we mean by "scaling"?</p>
<p><strong>7:19</strong>: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/04/18/coursera/">Coursera and peer assessment</a></p>
<p><strong>12:19:</strong> &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/04/15/robot-essay-graders/">Robot essay graders</a>. &nbsp;Writing is thinking. &nbsp;"It isn't about being grammatically correct, which is easy to correct. &nbsp;It's about doing deep thinking," says Steve. &nbsp;How do we help students to believe they have a voice that matters, not just one that spells correctly.</p>
<p><strong>28:32: </strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/04/20/education-innovation-summit/">The Education Innovation Summit</a>. &nbsp;Wow. &nbsp;WTF.</p>
