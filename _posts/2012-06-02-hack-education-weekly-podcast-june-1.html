<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>In this week's episode we discuss:</p>
<p><strong>0:35:</strong> &nbsp;My new feature on "<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/05/31/best-new-educational-apps-may-2012/">new and noteworthy educational apps</a>" and why there aren't more (or, um, any) Android apps on this list.</p>
<p><strong>4:37:</strong>&nbsp; Interactive textbook publisher <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/05/30/inkling-finally-brings-its-interactive-textbooks-to-the-web/">Inkling's move to HTML5</a>&nbsp;and the importance of cross-platform support for educational technologies.</p>
<p><strong>13:27:</strong> &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/05/29/entrepreneurship-and-education/">Education and entrepreneurship</a> -- Steve and I have a really great discussion about risk, profits, markets, innovation and the need -- perhaps -- for more Elon Musks, even in the public sphere.</p>
