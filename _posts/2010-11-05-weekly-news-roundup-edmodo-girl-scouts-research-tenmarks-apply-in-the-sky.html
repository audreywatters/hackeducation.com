<p>Rather <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/girl_scouts_research_shows_how_social_networking_i.php">depressing findings</a> from the Girl Scouts Research Institute, which finds that social networking doesn't do much good for girls' self image.</p>
<p>Social learning network <a href="http://blog.edmodo.com/2010/11/02/edmodo-for-android-is-here/">Edmodo</a> has released its Android app.</p>
<p>comScore has released its latest stats, and found that <a href="http://pbskids.org/">PBS KIDS</a> is the #1 kid-oriented site for online videos.  PBS KIDS boasts 9.5 million unique visitors per month, and its traffic is up 28% year-over-year.  I don't know how the site's visitors compare with time spent on other sites, and as more and more of us turn to the Internet for TV, it will be interesting to see how this will impact PBS, who has made some nice <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/pbs_rolls_out_major_new_redesign.php">redesigns</a> lately to its front- and back-ends, as well as to its iPad and iPhone apps.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tenmarks.com/">TenMarks</a> has launched a free version of its math instruction program.  The free version allows teachers to sign up their classes for supplemental math practice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.applyinthesky.com/">Apply in the Sky</a> won first prize in the web category at last night's <a href="http://www.women2.org/">Women 2.0 Pitch Night.</a>.  Apply in the Sky seeks to make the process of applying to college easier.  The startup is focused currently on business school applicants, and despite my skepticism about grad school (bitter, bitter girl that I am) watching their pitch last night, I predict good things for this team.</p>
<p>The publisher Springer Verlag will offer an e-reader program that will give institutions <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/45000-libraries-say-no-drm--springer-agrees-.html">DRM-free</a> digital books.</p>
