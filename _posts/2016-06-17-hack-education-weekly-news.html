<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-06-16-edsurge-s-indian-twin">Here&#8217;s how Edsurge frames</a> the funding news about <strong>EdTechReview</strong>, which it suggests might be its &#8220;Indian twin&#8221;: &#8220; In India, EdTechReview has raised &#8216;an undisclosed amount of funding in its pre-Series A round from EVC Ventures,&#8217; according to YourStory. The Delhi-based startup currently offers news, reports, product reviews and plans to run a jobs board and conferences across the country.
