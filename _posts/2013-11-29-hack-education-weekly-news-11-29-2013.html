<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>Michael McVey, a school superintendent in <strong>Steubenville,</strong> Ohio has been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/11/25/steubenville-school-superintendent-indicted-for-obstruction-in-teen-rape-case/">indicted</a> on charges of obstructing justice and evidence-tampering for his role in the cover-up of the rape of a 16-year-old girl by two of football players.</p>
<p>The Connecticut Attorney General released a report (<a href="http://www.ct.gov/csao/lib/csao/Sandy_Hook_Final_Report.pdf">PDF</a>) on the <strong>Newtown</strong> school shootings that occurred in December of last year. While there are lots of details about the shooter, the report uncovered nothing to explain his motivations.</p>
<p>Faith Christian Academy <a href="http://jezebel.com/florida-school-forces-black-student-to-cut-hair-or-face-1472062679">told</a> 12-year-old <strong>Vanessa Van Dyke</strong> that she needed to either cut her hair or leave the school. The school initially said that Van Dyke&rsquo;s <strong>&ldquo;puffy&rdquo; hair</strong> was a distraction, but after the story was picked up by numerous news organizations, the school backed away from its expulsion threats.</p>
<p>It looks like New York governor <strong>Andrew Cuomo</strong> is joining the <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/11/26/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-standards/">growing list</a> of politicians who are <a href="http://wamc.org/post/cuomo-appears-distance-himself-common-core">distancing themselves</a> from the <strong>Common Core</strong>. (Mercedes Schneider counts 17 states experiencing Common Core &ldquo;<a href="http://deutsch29.wordpress.com/2013/11/23/common-core-unrest-obvious-in-17-states/">unrest</a>.&rdquo;)</p>
<h2>Solidarity Forever&hellip; Or Not</h2>
<p>After a lengthy legal battle, <strong>NYU</strong> has reached an agreement with graduate students, allowing them to vote to unionize. <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/143295/">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a> has more details.</p>
<p>An email from <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> professor Alexander Coward went viral last week (after it was heavily promoted by the university, it&rsquo;s worth noting). In it Coward told undergraduates that he planned to cover classes that would otherwise be cancelled as graduate students were taking part in a sympathy strike alongside the service workers&rsquo; union.

<p>More problems for <strong>LAUSD</strong>&rsquo;s <strong>iPad</strong> rollout as it appears the software licenses that come with the machines <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-1120-lausd-ipads-20131120,0,429771.story?track=rss#axzz2l7z1l8Yu">expire after 3 years</a>. Renewing these could cost between $50 to $100 per iPad &ndash; about $60 million. (I cannot understand how no one noticed this &rsquo;til now. Nobody really does read those Apple Terms of Service, do they?!)</p>
<p>The principal of <strong>Mountrath Community College</strong> is calling the school&rsquo;s tablet adoption and move &ldquo;from book to <strong>e-book</strong>&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/education/switch-to-ebooks-was-an-unmitigated-disaster-says-school-principal-29767084.html">an unmitigated disaster</a>.&rdquo; The school has had technical issues with the majority of the HP Elite Pad tablets families were asked to purchase.</p>
<p>The online for-profit <strong>Strayer University</strong> is <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2013/11/22/strayer-cuts-tuition-by-as-much-as-40.html">slashing its tuition</a> by as much as 40% and is laying off 20% of its workforce in order to stem losses stemming from declining enrollment.</p>
<h2>MOOCs</h2>
<p>Those who&rsquo;ve enrolled in <strong>Coursera</strong>-run classes taught by <strong>Wesleyan</strong> faculty found themselves on the <a href="https://twitter.com/cogdog/status/405058938493612032/photo/1">receiving end of emails</a> asking them to donate to the university&rsquo;s fund in order to support its efforts to offer more Coursera courses.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p>The Wall Street Journal covers a study by <strong>Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service</strong> which finds that &ldquo;nearly half of the nation&rsquo;s colleges and universities are no longer generating enough tuition revenue to keep pace with inflation.&rdquo; <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/quiet-revolution-college-pricing-effects/">Phil Hill</a> and <a href="http://bryanalexander.org/2013/11/25/higher-education-finances-still-in-crunch-mode/">Bryan Alexander</a> respond.</p>
<p>And in other <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131119/SCHOOLS/311190079/Michigan-schools-financial-crisis-growing">Moody&rsquo;s-related news</a>, &ldquo;a growing number of <strong>Michigan</strong> school districts face higher borrowing costs after downgrades this year by Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service.&rdquo; Since January, it has downgraded the credit ratings of 53 districts in the state.</p>
<p>Cue the <strong>STEM shortage</strong> panic! &ldquo;About half of bachelor&rsquo;s degree candidates in science, technology, engineering and math leave the field before completing a college degree, according to a report from the U.S. Education Department&rsquo;s National Center for Education Statistics,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/27/study-tracks-attrition-rates-stem-majors">writes Inside Higher Ed</a>, which then adds that &ldquo;That might seem high, but it roughly tracks the rate at which students in other majors &ndash; like humanities, education and health sciences &ndash; switched majors or dropped out of college, too, the study found.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Maricopa Community College</strong> <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/quickwire-security-lapse-at-arizona-community-colleges-could-affect-2-5-million/48689">said</a> that it was in the process of notifying some 2.5 million students, employers, and suppliers that their personal data might have been compromised and exposed to &ldquo;unauthorized viewers.&rdquo; This includes birth dates, Social Security numbers, and bank account info.</p>
<p>Valleywag&rsquo;s Sam Biddle <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/zuckerberg-wants-your-kids-student-data-1472766797">attempts to raise some red flags</a> about the &ldquo;iffy fine print&rdquo; in the agreements that schools are signing with <strong>Code.org</strong>, including collecting students&rsquo; achievement data for the preceding 4 to 6 years as part of a longitudinal study. The contract also requires teachers to agree to 2 years participating in the project (which includes professional development and a proprietary curriculum that teachers aren&rsquo;t supposed to deviate from).</p>
