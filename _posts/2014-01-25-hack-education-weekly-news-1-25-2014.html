<h2>Suspensions</h2>

<p>After penning a letter to the campus protesting proposed budget cuts, <strong>CSU</strong> sociology professor Tim McGettigan had his <a href="http://aaupcolorado.org/2014/01/18/the-children-of-ludlow-tim-mcgettigans-offending-email-and-csu-pueblos-response/">email suspended</a> by the university. McGettigan&rsquo;s email compared the budget cuts to the Ludlow massacres (the massacre in 1914 of striking coal miners in the region). The university said the email was a threat and <a href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2014/01/20/wow-just-wow-2/">compared McGettigan to the shooters at Columbine and Virginia Tech</a>. By the end of the week &ndash; after a huge outcry about academic freedom and the administration&rsquo;s inability to grasp analogy, McGettigan&rsquo;s email was restored. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/20/colorado-state-removes-email-account-professor-who-criticized-cuts">More via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Harvard</strong> plans to offer <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/21/harvard-u-experiments-three-versions-same-course">3 versions of its Introduction to Computer Science</a> course this spring: Version 1: a HarvardX version (free, self-paced, for no credit).
