<h2>The Hype of MOOCs</h2>
<p>One of the most talked-about trends in education technology in recent years is the MOOC, the massive open online course. Indeed <em>The New York Time</em>s dubbed 2012 &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html">The Year of the MOOC</a>&rdquo;  after a number of high profile professors from high profile  universities launched well-funded and much-ballyhooed companies to offer  free university-level courses online: the launch of <a href="http://udacity.com">Udacity</a> by Stanford AI professor Sebastian Thrun, the launch of <a href="http://coursera.com">Coursera</a> by Stanford AI professors Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng, and the launch of <a href="http://edx.org">edX</a>, a joint partnership (initially) between Harvard and MIT.</p>
<p>Although  neither online education nor open education are new (and nor are  multi-million dollar investments in such efforts), MOOCs seem to have  captured the imagination of many in the press and in school  administration. As some headlines have boldly proclaimed, MOOCs will  mean &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/15/how-californias-new-online-education-pilot-will-end-college-as-we-know-it/">the end of college as we know it</a>." While that's not necessarily the case, it's probably worth knowing what all the hype is about...</p>
<h2>A Brief History of MOOCs</h2>
<p>The  acronym stands for Massive Open Online Course. And while those words  together might sound like an obvious sort of online education, each of  these words is actually incredibly fraught when it comes to envisioning  just what MOOCs might entail &mdash; pedagogically, technologically, and so  on. &ldquo;Open&rdquo; in particular is interpreted in many ways: "open" as in open  enrollment, openly-licensed content, or open-endedness.</p>
<p>The term  &ldquo;MOOC&rdquo; was actually coined in 2008, well before &ldquo;the Year of the MOOC.&rdquo;  Nevertheless, Stanford and particularly Sebastian Thrun and his Stanford  colleagues have received most of the credit in the mainstream press for  &ldquo;inventing&rdquo; the MOOC.</p>
<p>MOOCs have a longer history, dating back to  some of the early open online learning experiments conducted by Dave  Cormier, George Siemens, Stephen Downes, Alec Couros, David Wiley and  others. Downes and Siemens&rsquo; 2008 class "Connectivism and Connective  Knowledge,&rdquo; for example, was offered to some 20-odd tuition-paying  students at the University of Manitoba, along with over 2300 who signed  up for a free and open version online.</p>
<p>Stephen Downes has made the <a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/58676">distinction</a>&nbsp;between  &ldquo;cMOOCs,&rdquo; the types he and other open educators have offered, and  &ldquo;xMOOCs,&rdquo; those offered by Udacity, Coursera, edX and others. The  terminology is very useful to help distinguish between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism">connectivist</a>&nbsp;origins  of MOOCs (and the connectivist principles and practices of open  learning and online networks) and the MOOCs that have made headlines  (with their emphasis on lecture videos and multiple choice tests). While  cMOOCs are strongly connectivist and Canadian, some have suggested  that&nbsp;<a href="http://mikecaulfield.com/2012/09/01/why-we-shouldnt-talk-moocs-as-meritocracies/">xMOOCs exist</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;at the intersection of Wall Street and Silicon Valley.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>xMOOC vs cMOOC Technology and Pedagogy</h2>
<p>While  much of the mainstream press&rsquo;s attention to MOOCs has focused on the  content, the class sizes, and the (potential) credentials, the  technology that underpins these online courses is incredibly important  too &mdash; and something certainly that highlights the differences between  xMOOCs and cMOOCs.</p>
<p>The cMOOCs often rely on tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>,  sometimes known as &ldquo;really simple syndication.&rdquo; RSS is used to  syndicate content from blog posts, but it also makes possible the  aggregation of content and resources. In other words, rather than  driving users to a particular course website or a learning management  system for all their interactions, the users in cMOOCs work in their own  online spaces. Their work is then syndicated, through RSS, to a hub for  the course.</p>
<p>xMOOCs tend to look more like learning management  systems. They rely heavily on video-based lectures and discussion  forums, most of which resides on the main course site. Some xMOOCs  utilize automated assessment. edX is working on automated essay-graders,  for example while Coursera wants to be able to combine automation with  peer-based assessment.</p>
<p>The technologies of these different MOOCs  reflect signficant differences in pedagogy. As George Siemens writes of  the pedagogical differences between xMOOCs and cMOOCs and the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2012/06/03/what-is-the-theory-that-underpins-our-moocs/">theories that underpin</a>&rdquo; them,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The  Coursera/edX MOOCs adopt a traditional view of knowledge and learning.  Instead of distributed knowledge networks, their MOOCs are based on a  hub and spoke model: the faculty/knowledge at the centre and the  learners are replicators or duplicators of knowledge. That statement is a  bit unfair (if you took the course with Scott E. Page at Coursera,  you&rsquo;ll recognize that the content is not always about duplication). Nor  do our MOOCs rely only on generative knowledge. In all of the MOOCs I&rsquo;ve  run, readings and resources have been used that reflect the current  understanding of experts in the field. We ask learners, however, to go  beyond the declarations of knowledge and to reflect on how different  contexts impact the structure (even relevance) of that knowledge.  Broadly, however, generative vs. declarative knowledge captures the  epistemological distinctions between our MOOCs and the Coursera/edX  MOOCs. Learners need to create and share stuff &ndash; blogs, articles,  images, videos, artifacts, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>MOOCs in K-12</h2>
<p>MOOCs  have been primarily discussed as something aimed at university-level  students &mdash; a way for students to be able to obtain a college-level  coursework for free (not a surprising trend considering the increasing  costs of college tuition). However, the demographics of those signing up  for (and perhaps completing) MOOCs indicates that many of these  students already have college degrees. There is some concern about the  completion rates in MOOCs &mdash; it hovers around <a href="http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html">13%</a>&nbsp;--  although it's fair to say that plenty of those who sign up for free  courses have little intention of ever completing then. Nevertheless,  it&rsquo;s worth asking who MOOCs work for. US students? Those with degrees?  Low-income students? Women? First generation college students? Adult  learners? High school students?</p>
<p>Despite concerns about successful  completion, there have been some recent initiatives to pursue MOOCs in  K12. (Although it&rsquo;s probably worth noting here that as MOOCs have become  buzzwords in ed-tech, many online courses are being labeled as MOOCs,  whether they&rsquo;re free or openly accessible or not.) News Corps&rsquo; education  division <a href="https://users-mooc.amplify.com/">Amplify</a> says it plans to offer MOOCs for AP Computer Science.&nbsp;&nbsp;(These courses are <em>not</em> free.) And&nbsp;<a href="https://users-mooc.amplify.com/">edX is working with</a> the College Board and Davidson College to offer MOOCs for AP calculus, macroeconomics, and physics.</p>
<p>These  are all fairly traditional courses that fulfill fairly traditional  educational goals. The difference: &nbsp;now these courses are being offered  online. These AP course MOOCs bear little resemblance to the types of  open online learning that the originators of the term &ldquo;MOOC&rdquo; envisioned.  Rather than knowledge-building in the hands of the learner, these MOOCs  continue to be designed so that content is delivered by the instructor  or by the platform. Rather than occurring on one's personal domain (a  blog, for example) where a learner gets to reflect on her or his  learning experiences, these MOOCs require students participate in  traditional assessments &mdash; often in a closed platform with proprietary  content.</p>
<p>Perhaps MOOCs aren't that disruptive after all...</p>
