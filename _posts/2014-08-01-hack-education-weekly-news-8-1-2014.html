<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>Former CNN and NBC news anchor <strong>Campbell Brown</strong> is <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/07/28/336050469/teacher-tenure-challenge-spreads-from-california-to-new-york">leading a group</a> that filed a lawsuit in <strong>New York</strong> this week to challenge <strong>teacher tenure</strong> rules in the state. (The Shanker Institute&rsquo;s Matthew Di Carlo has a good look at some of the &ldquo;<a href="http://shankerblog.org/?p=10272">research</a>&rdquo; being cited by the group, Partnership for Educational Justice, as rationale for ending tenure.)</p>
<p>The <strong>Louisiana</strong> Board of Elementary and Secondary Education is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/29/bobby-jindal-lawsuit_n_5631416.html">suing</a> <strong>Governor Bobby Jindal</strong> over steps he&rsquo;s taking to sever ties with <strong>Common Core</strong>-related vendors. Jindal filed a countersuit because that&rsquo;s how we roll in America.</p>
<p>Senators Edward Markey and Orinn Hatch have introduced the <strong>Protecting Student Privacy Act</strong> which will offer an <a href="http://www.govtech.com/education/Senate-Ponders-Student-Data-Privacy-Bill.html">update to <strong>FERPA</strong></a> (one that doesn&rsquo;t seem to address any aspects of the law that make it such a horrible mess. It doesn&rsquo;t address, for example, the changing meaning of &ldquo;educational record&rdquo; and it doesn&rsquo;t address the &ldquo;death penalty&rdquo; provisions, which tie privacy violations to the loss of all federal funding).</p>
<p><strong>Abigail Fisher</strong>, who sued the <strong>University of Texas</strong> for denying her admission, <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/07/30/woman-appeals-ruling-on-texas-affirmative.html">is appealing</a> the recent ruling of the 5th Circuit Court that upheld UT&rsquo;s <strong>affirmative action</strong> program.</p>
<p>Senator Dick Durbin has <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/08/01/student-debt-relief-adjuncts-bill">sponsored</a> the <strong>Adjunct Faculty Loan Fairness Act</strong>, which would make contingent instructors eligible for student loan forgiveness.</p>
<p><a href="http://tn.chalkbeat.org/2014/07/31/tennessee-dusts-off-cursive-writing-creates-new-standards-for-it/"><strong>Tennessee</strong>&rsquo;s Department of Education</a> &ldquo;is moving toward standards that would reinvigorate the teaching of <strong>cursive handwriting</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American Institutes for Research <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/07/air_says_it_will_appeal_big_pearson_common-core_contract_in_nm_court.html">says</a> it is appealing a recent decision that okayed the awarding of the major <strong>PARCC</strong> testing contract to <strong>Pearson</strong>, a process that AIR claims was unfair.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri</strong> Governor Jay Nixon has signed a bill extending existing <strong>privacy laws for library records</strong> to include materials related to e-books, streaming video, and downloadable audiobooks. More <a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2014/07/digitization/missouri-extends-protection-library-records-data-digital-materials/">via School Library Journal</a>.</p>
<p>A Senate report finds that <strong>for-profit colleges</strong> are increasingly targeting <strong>military veterans</strong>. <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/for-profit-colleges-increasingly-targeting-veterans-new-sena">Buzzfeed&rsquo;s Molly Hensley-Clancy writes</a>, &ldquo;Overall enrollment in for-profit colleges has been in steep decline since 2009. In that same time frame, the report says, veteran enrollment at the country&rsquo;s largest for-profit colleges has &lsquo;dramatically increased,&rsquo; with almost a third of veterans using GI Bill funding now attending for-profit colleges, up from 23% in 2009.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to stop cheating, the <strong>Air Force</strong> <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/07/28/334501037/to-stop-cheating-nuclear-officers-ditch-the-grades">dropped <strong>grading</strong></a> as part of the examination procedures for its nuclear officers. And yay, but let&rsquo;s drop nukes too. Thanks in advance.</p>
<h2>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Reports of MOOCs&rsquo; demise have been greatly exaggerated,&rdquo; <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/content/reports-moocs-demise-greatly-exaggerated_16836/">writes Craig Weidemann, vice provost for online education at <strong>Penn State</strong></a>. Clearly, because people are still writing stories with bullshit headlines like &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/07/how-online-courses-are-becoming-educations-new-wave/375152/">Will Free Online Courses Ever Replace a College Education?</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/what-69-million-clicks-tell-us-about-how-fix-online-education">What <strong>6.9 million clicks</strong> tell us about how to fix online education</a>&rdquo; (the &ldquo;us&rdquo; here is <strong>MIT</strong>&rsquo;s AI Lab): things like we need to make &ldquo;&lsquo;YouTube for MOOCs&rsquo; that seeks to reinvent how online learners watch videos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can You Really Teach a MOOC in a <strong>Refugee Camp</strong>?&rdquo; <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/can-you-really-teach-a-mooc-in-a-refugee-camp/54191">asks The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>. (I wrote about <a href="http://modernlearners.com/teaching-and-learning-in-the-midst-of-crisis/">ed-tech and refugee education</a> this week on EML too. Paywalled, sorry.)</p>
<p>Telefonica and Banco Santander are <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/07/28/telefonica-launches-first-spanish-language-mooc-platform.aspx">launching</a> a Spanish-language MOOC platform, <strong>MiriadaX</strong>.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for the innovation of MOOCs because, <a href="http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/07/campus-tech-2014-reinventing-higher-education">according to <strong>edX</strong>&rsquo;s Anant Agarwal</a>, "&ldquo;The last time we gave teachers a new tool was 1862: a piece of chalk and a chalkboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspired by Khan Academy,&rdquo; <strong>Kim Gordon</strong>, <strong>Yoko Ono</strong>, <strong>Courtney Love</strong>, and others are launching an online art school for girls: <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/kim-gordon-yoko-ono-courtney-love-and-more-help-la-207477">the School for Doodle</a>.</p>

But NBD because it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/California-Drought-Water-Supply-269378311.html">drought</a> here in California or anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/morning_call/2014/07/university-of-california-investment-policy.html">Big-name VCs, others tagged to weigh changes to <strong>UC</strong> investment policy</a>.&rdquo; What could possibly go wrong.</p>
<p>In the next phase of the ongoing battles over its future, <strong>City College of San Francisco</strong> <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/07/30/ccsf-applies-accreditation-restoration-option">has applied</a> to have its accreditation status restored.</p>

<p><a href="http://hechingerreport.org/content/new-jersey-school-district-decided-giving-laptops-students-terrible-idea_16866/">This story</a> from the <strong>Hoboken School District</strong> of its plans to destroy, yes destroy, all its laptops from its &ldquo;failed&rdquo; <strong>1:1 laptop program</strong> details an amazing amount of administrative incompetence. And this line, from the district&rsquo;s network engineer, makes me furious: &ldquo;There is no more determined hacker, so to speak, than a 12-year-old who has a computer.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Go, School Sports Team!</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The <strong>National Collegiate Athletics Association</strong> will establish a $70 million fund for testing and diagnosing <strong>concussions</strong> in current and former college athletes,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/30/ncaa-settlement-includes-70-million-concussion-testing">reports Inside Higher Ed</a>. But the fund will not pay for treatment. Assholes.</p>
<h2>From the HR Department</h2>

<p>Tim Torkildson says he was fired as the blogger for the Nomen Global Language Center after writing a post on <strong>homophones</strong>. The owner of the business <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/58236366-90/says-english-homophones-language.html.csp">feared</a> the post would associate the company with <strong>homosexuality</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Scholastic</strong> is closing its <strong>eStoria</strong> bookstore and switching to a streaming model. On the company website: &ldquo;With the launch of Storia School Edition on September 1, Scholastic will transition to a streaming model for children&rsquo;s eBook delivery. The switch to streaming means that eBooks you&rsquo;ve previously purchased may soon no longer be accessible.&rdquo; A reminder that you often don&rsquo;t &ldquo;own&rdquo; your digital stuff; you merely license it.
