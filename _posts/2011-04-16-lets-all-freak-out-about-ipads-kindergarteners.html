<p>I like Maine a lot.  It's a beautiful place -- oh my, the blueberries! --  and my little brother and his family live there.  But that's not the only thing that makes me biased in favor of the state.</p>
<p>Maine has been at the forefront of one-to-one computing initiatives, dating all the way back to 2002 when the state launched a program putting laptops in the hands of all seventh and eighth graders.  That's almost ten years of thinking about the impact of one-to-one technology -- how it changes (and whether it changes) teaching and learning.</p>
<p>So I admit, I was a little surprised this week when the news that a school district in Maine is investing in iPads for their kindergarteners was viewed with such shock and outrage.  I first heard the news a couple of weeks ago from my friend <a href="http://multiplepathways.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/ipads-to-come-to-auburn-kindergarden-classrooms/">Mike Muir</a>, who's just started working in the Auburn School District.  Interesting, I thought -- let's see how this is different from other one-to-one initiatives in the state.  Let's see how iPads are different from laptops.  Let's see how kindergarteners (and their teachers) use the devices differently than other age groups do.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20052512-71.html">titillating quotation</a> from the district superintendent Tom Morrill that an iPad is "even more important than a book" that set folks off.  Perhaps it was the large expenditure -- $200,000 -- in a time when many schools are facing budget crises.  I'm not sure.  But there were a lot of stories that frowned on the project, and I found myself engaging in a Twitter spat over the issue with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465014917/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hackeduc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0465014917">Diane Ravitch</a><img class="edxthpuonfbwajskkhux" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0465014917" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> who set up what I perceived as a false dichotomy:  kids get <em>either</em> play <em>or</em> technology.  Kids get <em>either</em> books and crayons <em>or</em> iPads.</p>

<p>Now, I do think that we need to do much more than pass out iPads and assume that because we've equipped students with a technology tool that we've magically "changed the game."  I think the decade-long experiment with laptops in Maine classrooms has demonstrated that.  Why, test-scores in the state haven't risen!  So clearly it's a waste of money!  (That's sarcasm, folks, just so we're clear.)  One-to-one computing, when done well, does require a shift in instruction, moving away from the teacher-at-the-front-of-the-classroom dynamic.  It isn't simply about implementing a new technology; it's about rethinking the classroom.  That's something to praise, not panic over.</p>
<p>But lest you need something to make your toes curl, to make you fearful of the future of small children and iPads, let me tell you this:  Random House has just released the childhood favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307120007/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hackeduc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307120007">Pat the Bunny</a><img class="edxthpuonfbwajskkhux" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307120007" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> as an <a href="www.rhkidsapps.com/patthebunny">iPad app</a>.  Think of how we're skewing children's experience with touching and feeling! Clearly it's time to freak out now, don't you think?</p>
