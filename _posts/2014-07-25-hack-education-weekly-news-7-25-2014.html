<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p><strong>Rand Paul</strong> is planning &ldquo;a major push on education reform, including &lsquo;education choice, school choice, vouchers, charter schools, you name it &mdash; I think we need innovation,&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0714/morningeducation14754.html">reports Politico</a>. Among the innovations Paul likes: <strong>Khan Academy</strong>. &ldquo;If you have one person in the country who is, like, the best at explaining calculus, that person maybe should teach every calculus class in the country.&rdquo; Pando has <a href="http://pando.com/2014/07/18/homophobia-racism-and-the-kochs-san-franciscos-tech-libertarian-reboot-conference-is-a-cesspool/">a story</a> on the libertarian conference held in Silicon Valley last weekend where Paul also spoke, <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/status/490597675457204224">praising Khan Academy again</a>.</p>
<p>I forgot to note this momentous occasion last week: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/quiz/2014/jul/15/michael-gove-memorable-moments-quiz?CMP=twt_gu"><strong>Michael Gove</strong></a> is no longer the British Secretary of State for Education. (He&rsquo;s now the Chief Whip. And he&rsquo;s still <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/383316/well-miss-you-michael-gove-chester-e-finn-jr">a total tool</a>.)</p>
<p>The <strong>Department of Education</strong> <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/guidance-schools-issued-how-keep-parents-better-informed-data-they-collect-stude">issued new guidelines</a> on how schools should handle telling parents about the <strong>data</strong> they collect on students.</p>
<p>A new privacy group launched this week, the <a href="http://www.studentprivacymatters.org/?p=130"><strong>Parent Coalition for Student Privacy</strong></a>. Among those in the coalition, <a href="http://dianeravitch.net/2014/07/23/new-group-asks-congress-to-protect-student-privacy/"><strong>Diane Ravitch</strong></a>, <strong>Leonie Haimson</strong>, the (anti-vaccine) <strong>Autism Action Network</strong>, the (anti-LGBTQ, anti-immigration, anti-public pension, anti-choice) <strong>American Principles Project</strong>, and Joy Pullmann the editor of <strong>School Reform News</strong> (who&rsquo;s tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/JoyPullmann/status/491255096777261056">gems</a> like this). As someone who spends a lot of time talking about student data and privacy, I am appalled by this &ldquo;coalition,&rdquo; and have to ask how anyone would expect some of these groups, which actively work against the civil rights of others, to defend all students&rsquo; rights to data and information or to privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn Beck</strong> led an anti-<strong>Common Core</strong> <a href="http://www.glennbeck.com/conform/">event</a> this week (and conveniently plugged his new book).</p>
<p>Oops. If you entered a dollar figure that included cents into the Income Earned From Work field of your <strong>FAFSA</strong>, the &ldquo;system ignored the decimal point, converting an earned income of $5,000.19, for example, into $500,019.&rdquo; The <strong>Department of Education</strong> will <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/147829/">reprocess</a> the 200,000-ish applications affected.</p>

<p>Who will be the winners and losers from <strong>E-Rate</strong> &ldquo;modernization,&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/07/the_winners_and_losers_in_e-rate_modernization.html">asks Education Week</a>. Winners: broadband providers and ed-tech companies. Congrats!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawyers for a southwest Missouri school district being sued by the parents of a boy who killed himself last year have filed a request seeking all of the <strong>Facebook</strong> messages, photographs, videos and other communication saved by the student.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.kmbc.com/news/school-seeks-deceased-boys-records-in-bullying-lawsuit/27048742#!bmkxXS">Good grief</a>.</p>

<h2>Other Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Ed-tech companies have terrible names.</strong> <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/whats-in-an-ed-tech-name-heres-all-u-need-2gno/54087">News at 11</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Knewton</strong> has <a href="http://www.knewton.com/blog/adaptive-learning/knewton-partners-sesame-workshop/">partnered</a> with the <strong>Sesame Workshop</strong>. Sad Grover shrug.</p>
<p><strong>Khan Academy</strong> has <a href="http://khanacademy.tumblr.com/post/92470472365/the-british-museum-and-khan-academy-a-partnership-for">partnered</a> with the <strong>British Museum</strong>.</p>

<h2>Funding and Acquisitions</h2>
<p><strong>Mergers</strong> and <strong>acquisitions</strong> in education are up in the first half of 2014 &ndash; 160 transactions, up from 147 during the first half of last year &ndash; <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/07/mergers_acquisitions_on_the_rise_in_2014_report_shows.html">according to investment bank Berkery Noyes</a>.</p>
