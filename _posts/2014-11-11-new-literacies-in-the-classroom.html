<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This post first appeared on<a href="http://modernlearners.com/new-literacies-in-the-classroom/"> Educating Modern Learners</a></em></p>
<h2>Changing Definitions of Literacy</h2>
<p>Literacy,  defined most simply, is the ability to read and write. But  increasingly, we recognize that such a basic definition does not convey  the power &ndash; economic, political, social, cultural &ndash; that comes with  literacy (or the lack of power that accompanies illiteracy).</p>
<p><a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001362/136246e.pdf">UNESCO, for example, defines literacy</a> as "<em>the  ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and  compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying  contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling  individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and  potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider society</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even this definition, now a decade old, fails to articulate how literacy might change in an &ldquo;information age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New  literacies&rdquo; that arise from new technologies include things like  text-messaging, blogging, social networking, podcasting, and  videomaking. These digital technologies alter and extend our  communication abilities, often blending text, sound, and imagery.  Although connected to older, &ldquo;offline&rdquo; practices, these technologies  change what it means to both &ldquo;read&rdquo; and &ldquo;write&rdquo; texts. (They change the  meaning of &ldquo;text,&rdquo; as well.)</p>
<p>These rise of &ldquo;new literacies&rdquo; necessary to wield these new technologies effectively place new demands on all of us &ndash; <em>not just on students</em>.  We are all expected to move much more quickly to identify problems, for  example; to know where to find information to help us address those  problems &ndash; often on our own; to evaluate and synthesize information from  a number of sources in order to try to solve those problems; to  communicate with others about problems and potential solutions; and to  monitor the solutions we&rsquo;ve found and stay up-to-date with new issues as  they arise.</p>
<p>We are increasingly expected do these tasks via the  Internet, of course, to address elements of our professional and our  personal lives. We do this as students, teachers, workers, and citizens  alike.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s still useful to think about how many these  new literacies do dovetail with that UNESCO definition too: to identify  and interpret materials. But it&rsquo;s important to consider how these  practices, particularly when they&rsquo;re online, shape comprehension and  interpretation in new ways. How do these new practices shape community  participation in the construction of knowledge?</p>
<p>For educators,  this must involve a more sophisticated response than the Internet is  &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; Moreover, it isn&rsquo;t just a matter of thinking about  potentially different <em>cognitive</em> experiences of reading digital  versus print materials (although there is a growing body of research to  that end). It&rsquo;s about thinking about how students &ldquo;move through&rdquo;  materials as they read and research and how digital materials make that a  fundamentally different process.</p>
<h2>Learners &amp; New Literacies</h2>
<p>University of Connecticut&rsquo;s Donald Leu (<a href="http://www.reading.org/Libraries/books/IRA-710-chapter42.pdf">PDF</a>) has made several observations about these new literacies:</p>
<ol> </ol>
<ul>
<li><em><em>Online research and comprehension is a self-directed process of text construction and knowledge construction.</em></em></li>
<li><em><em>Five  practices appear to define online research and comprehension  processing: (1) identifying a problem and then (2) locating, (3)  evaluating, (4) synthesizing, and (5) communicating information.</em></em></li>
<li><em><em>Online  research and comprehension is not isomorphic with offline reading  comprehension; additional skills and strategies appear to be required.</em></em></li>
<li><em><em>Online contexts may be especially supportive for some struggling readers.</em></em></li>
<li><em><em>Adolescents are not always very skilled with online research and comprehension.</em></em></li>
<li><em>Collaborative online reading and writing practices appear to increase comprehension and learning.</em></li>
</ul>
<ol> </ol>
<p>Number 5 on this list in particular highlights how dangerous the myth of the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native">digital native</a>&rdquo;  can be &ndash; this idea that students born in an information age are somehow  naturally or automatically predisposed to understand new information  technologies. It is true (according to <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/07/23/13-things-to-know-about-teens-and-technology/">research from the Pew Research Center</a>)  that many teens now lead &ldquo;tech-saturated lives&rdquo;: 95% use the Internet.  78% have cell phones. 80% have a desktop or laptop. 81% use social  networking sites. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are necessarily highly  skilled when it comes to these new literacies. And as Leu points out  too, having &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; literacy skills isn&rsquo;t an indicator of having  these new proficiencies either.</p>
<h2>New Literacies and the Classroom</h2>
<p>How  will the role of educators change with the rise of new literacies? This  is particularly important as students (again, all of us) have to  navigate more complex and more rich media &ndash; online and not just in  print.</p>
<p>With a world of digital materials at students&rsquo; fingertips,  traditional instructional materials like textbooks are no longer  canonical. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the role of the educator is  necessarily diminished. To the contrary, educators could be even more  important as they guide students through the <em>contexts</em> of learning materials, not simply the <em>content</em>. Again, as Leu points out, collaborative practices seem to help boost learning.</p>
<p><em>This has profoundly important implications for educators&rsquo; professional development</em>, something that cannot be addressed by treating new technologies as new <em>instructional</em> tools. Educators must develop these new literacies themselves &ndash; <em>for themselves</em> &ndash; before they can support students in developing them for themselves.  Educators must learn to engage with new technologies and the literacy  practices surrounding them (by blogging, for example, or by gaming).</p>
<p>New  literacies will bring about new challenges for schools, because in no  small part, new technologies (and the cultural practices around them)  are changing incredibly quickly. All this in turn raises important  questions about how &ndash; indeed, whether &ndash; new literacies &ldquo;fit&rdquo; into  current school practices, and how schools will respond.</p>
<h2>Reflecting on Your Own Literacies...</h2>
<p><em>What  are some of the new literacies that you believe you have developed as a  result of new technologies? What are some of the new literacies you  recognize you lack? </em></p>
<p><em>How can schools support all members  of their community -- teachers, administrators, students, parents -- in  developing these new literacies?</em></p>
