<p>Lego is launching a new product line January 1:  Lego Friends.  Lego Friends is Lego for girls. The sets feature curvy dolls with big eyes and cute smiles, dolls who love animals, hairdressing, shopping, and science. Um yeah.</p>
<p>"<a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx">The Beauty of Building</a>," says Lego. OMFG.</p>
<p>When I first heard the news, I tweeted something along the lines of "there already is Lego for girls.  It's called Lego."  But I went shopping for my nephew the other day, and although I loathe the "princess phase" with every tattooed bitchy punk-ass bone in my body, I gotta admit:  most Legos on the shelf right now are for boys.</p>
<p>Will Lego Friends help Lego win the "girl market"?  Honestly, I don't care, unless you can demonstrate to me that it's going to be as strong a path to STEM as "Lego for boys" has become.</p>
