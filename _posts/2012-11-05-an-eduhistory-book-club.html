<p><em>This is still a germ of an idea, but it&rsquo;s a germ of an idea that&rsquo;s already spawned a collaborative Google Doc and a blog post, and with that we are officially off and running&hellip;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;So Let&rsquo;s Start An #eduhistory Book Club, Then?&rdquo; <a href="http://budtheteacher.com/blog/2012/11/05/so-lets-start-an-eduhistory-book-club-then/#comments">writes</a> Bud Hunt, observing that &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know our history. And it&rsquo;s killing us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I agree. And I&rsquo;m troubled. &ldquo;I worry about the lack of historical knowledge about education technology, and not just in a George Santayana &lsquo;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it&rsquo; sort of way,&rdquo; I wrote in <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=0ab07657df870af8eb101b4e5&amp;id=7aad1ce132">my newsletter</a> this weekend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stories we tell about the past aren&rsquo;t simply about the past. These stories reflect the present and shape the future. History is, after all, not simply a record of all that has happened; it is both a narrative and an argument. History can be wielded in powerful ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We see history wielded more and more in discussions about education and education technology. Take <a href="/2012/11/01/history-of-education-khan-academy/">Sal Khan&rsquo;s History of Education</a>, for example, that leaves out the entire twentieth century and the contributions of progressive education. Or the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html">histories of MOOCs</a> that leave out their pioneers, the connectivists. "Why all this revisionist history?" <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/status/264785377674547200">I wondered aloud</a> last week. (I bet <a href="http://third-bit.com/blog/archives/4546.html">we know the answer</a>, don't we.)</p>
<p>So Bud suggests we start a book club, beginning with a text that Khan maligned in his history video: <a href="http://archive.org/details/cu31924030593580">The Committee of Ten Report</a>. Issued in 1892, this report helped establish the curriculum of the American public education system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be joining Bud to run some Google Hangouts to discuss this and the other texts we tackle. More details on the schedule to come. And more information over on <a href="http://budtheteacher.com/blog/2012/11/05/so-lets-start-an-eduhistory-book-club-then/">Bud's blog</a>.</p>
