<p>It&#8217;s time once again for my annual review of &#8220;the year in education technology,&#8221; something I&#8217;ve done since 2010. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll launch the seventh edition of this massive, maniacal undertaking.</p>

<p>This year feels different, perhaps because it&#8217;s the first time that I end the year knowing the new one will bring us a new President, one with quite different goals than the current administration&#8217;s. Things feel quite uncertain moving forward, despite all the certainty one can supposedly muster from looking back &#8211; from looking at the near-term or long-term history and trends. I&#8217;m feeling quite tentative about whether or not the insights that I might be able to glean about the year will have much relevance for the business and politics of education technology under Trump. I&#8217;m quite frightened that some of the &#8220;worst case scenarios&#8221; I&#8217;ve imagined for education technology &#8211; the normalization of surveillance, algorithmic bias, privatization, radical individualization &#8211; are poised to be the new reality.</p>

<p>This year feels different too than the previous years in which I&#8217;ve written these reviews because education technology &#8211; as an industry &#8211; sort of floundered in 2016, as I think my series will show. Investment dollars were down, if nothing else. I suppose some analysts would argue education technology, as an industry, &#8220;matured&#8221; this year &#8211; young startup founders were replaced by old white men as chief executives, young startups were acquired by old, established corporations. But all in all, there just isn&#8217;t much to speak of this year when it comes to spectacular &#8220;innovation&#8221; (whatever you take that to mean). Or even when it comes to remarkable &#8220;failure&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.rolinmoe.org/main/krapps-last-failure-cv/">which I gather we&#8217;re supposed to praise these days</a>. </p>

<p>This year&#8217;s &#8220;Top Ed-Tech Trends&#8221; are mostly the same as previous years&#8217;, despite marketing efforts to hype certain (largely consumer) products &#8211; 3D printing, virtual reality, Pokemon Go, and so on. I&#8217;ve written before about &#8220;<a href="http://2013trends.hackeducation.com/zombies.html">ed-tech&#8217;s zombie ideas</a>&#8221; &#8211; about how monstrous ideas are repeatedly revived &#8211; and this year was no different. </p>

<p>We could ask, I suppose, why ed-tech might be in the doldrums &#8211; why no sweeping &#8220;revolution&#8221; despite all the investment and all the enthusiasm. (We can debate what that revolution would look like: institutional change, improved test scores, more or less job security?) Has education technology, or digital technology more broadly, simply become banal as it has become ubiquitous? </p>

<p>And yet, this moment feels anything if banal. Here we are with a President-Elect &#8211; a reality TV star &#8211; who has been supported by white nationalists, the KKK, Wikileaks, trolls, and Peter Thiel, who election was facilitated through a massive misinformation campaign spread virally through Facebook. Education technology, and again digital technology more broadly, might not be the progressive, democratizing force that some promised. Go figure.</p>

<p>So we must, I think, look at the more insidious ways in which various technologies <em>are</em> slowly altering our notions of knowledge, expertise, and education (as practices, as institutions, as systems) &#8211; and ask who&#8217;s invested in the various futures that education technology purports to offer.</p>

<h3>A Note on Methodology <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/icon_methodology.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>Each Friday, I gather all the education and education technology and technology-related news <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/2016/11/16/hack-education-weekly-news">into one article</a>. (I also gather articles that I read about the same topics for <a href="http://tinyletter.com/audreywatters">a newsletter</a> that I send out each Saturday.) Each month, I calculate <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">all the venture capital investment</a> that&#8217;s gone into education technology, noting who&#8217;s invested, the type of company, and so on. It&#8217;s from these weekly and monthly reports that I start to build my analysis. I listen to stories. I follow the money, and I follow the press releases. I try to verify the wild, wild claims. I look for patterns. It&#8217;s based on these patterns that I choose the ten of my &#8220;Top Ed-Tech Trends.&#8221; </p>

<p>They&#8217;re not all &#8220;trends,&#8221; really. They&#8217;re categories. But I&#8217;ve purposefully called this series &#8220;trends&#8221; because I like to imagine it helps defang some of the bulleted list of crap that other publications churn out, claiming that this or that product is going to &#8220;change everything&#8221; about how we teach and learn.</p>

<h3>Education Technology Criticism <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/icon_criticism.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>A note on the lenses through which I analyze ed-tech: History. Ideology. Labor. Power. Rhetoric. Ethics. Narrative. Networks. Humanities. Culture. Anti-racism. I guess I&#8217;ll add anti-fascism from here on out, just to be really clear.</p>

<p>Earlier this fall, Sara M. Watson published a lengthy piece for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, &#8220;<a href="http://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/constructive_technology_criticism.php#toward-constructive-criticism">Toward a Constructive Technology Criticism</a>.&#8221; Even though the opening paragraphs that spoke of &#8220;loom-smashing Luddites and told-you-so Cassandras,&#8221; I didn&#8217;t see much of myself in her description of the &#8220;technology criticism landscape,&#8221; despite the years now that I&#8217;ve been a landscaper. Watson&#8217;s suggestions for a &#8220;constructive technology criticism&#8221;: surface ideologies. Ask better questions. Offer alternatives. Be realistic. Be precise. Be generous. </p>

<p>Seven years and hundreds of thousands of words reviewing what&#8217;s happening to and through education technology is as generous I can be right now, I think.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve written in previous years. You can decide for yourself with how much my criticism has been heeded (hell, even acknowledged):</p>
