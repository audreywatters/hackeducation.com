<p><em>Each week, I gather a wide variety of links to education and education technology articles. In the past, this all feeds the reviews I have written each December on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the stories we are told</a> about the future of education. I&#8217;m ending that series, I think, so I can focus on writing books. That means, after next week, I&#8217;m ending this particular series too. The moose diarrhea salesmen will keep selling you stories about that future though, don&#8217;t worry. You&#8217;re just going to have to get better at refusing to buy and drink their soda.</em></p>
