<h2>So Long and Thanks for All the Fish</h2>
<p>I just got off the phone with Mike Lee, the founder of <a href="https://edshelf.com/">Edshelf</a>, a startup that recently announced <a href="http://edshelf.tumblr.com/post/90568827494/edshelf-to-shut-down">it was closing its doors</a> at the end of the month. <br /><br />There&rsquo;s been a grassroots hashtag campaign on the part of some educators to <a href="http://edutechstories.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/dont-leave-edtech-startups-sitting-on.html">#saveedshelf</a>, and while I understand the good intentions &mdash; Mike is a great guy, and it sucks that his startup isn&rsquo;t successful &mdash; I&rsquo;m not sure I understand why <em>this</em> particular startup should be saved. I&rsquo;m not sure why we&rsquo;d believe that an expression of support via social media would trump revenue. Retweets don&rsquo;t pay the bills, yo. Indeed, I think the whole thing comes close to reinscribing a dangerous narrative being promoted by investors and ed-tech industry cheerleaders that scale scale scale matters and then magically <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/How-an-Upstart-Company-Might/133065/">the money will follow</a>. <br /><br />The nature of the startup beast is failure, of course; most startups don&rsquo;t make it. Most businesses don&rsquo;t make it, true, but venture capitalists are playing a different game than are, say, the small business loan department at the local bank. VCs place a lot of bets, hoping at least one of their gambles pays off and pays off <em>big</em>.<br /><br />I think education startups have an even more difficult road to travel that other consumer or enterprise-focused venture-backed tech &mdash; issues of school culture, budgets, bureaucracy, tradition, test score mania, not to mention industry behemoths who&rsquo;ve lobbied their way into the decision-making at almost every levee of government. It doesn&rsquo;t help that many ed-tech startups receive lousy advice from folks who don&rsquo;t know jack shit about how schools work and are hoping instead to &ldquo;disrupt&rdquo; that process so that their own financial interests and processes and politics can triumph. Anyway...</p>
<h2>So Long, Farewell, Aufwiedersehn, Goodnight</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a strong background in business (<a href="http://audreywatters.com/disclosures/">disclosure</a>: I have zero background in business) but I&rsquo;ve been wondering for a while now if we&rsquo;re on the cusp of a "moment of reckoning" for venture-funded ed-tech startups. (Oh sure, I realize that&rsquo;s not the news you get from the sunny side of the street &mdash; you know, the news that&rsquo;s also funded by investors.) But here&rsquo;s the thing: startups have a fairly small window of opportunity in order to do <em>something</em> once they receive venture capital. Scale scale scale is one thing, sure. Find a business model is another. Ya know, make some money. Improve learning outcomes, LOL. <br /><br />That window may be closing (has closed?) for the startups who raised money when this most recent ed-tech hype cycle started. Can they demonstrate scale and revenue? Is there a return on investment? Do they have a clear exit strategy? (That is what investors want, after all.) I sensed this last year, and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/03/20/2010-2011-ed-tech-startups-updated/">I wrote a piece</a> reviewing the status of the startups that I covered when I was working at ReadWriteWeb, from the spring of 2010 to the summer of 2011. It's a good post. Go read it. Because in part I talk about what has survived (tl;dr it's not Google products; it's open source initiatives run by universities.)</p>
<p>Truthfully, I was actually surprised then to see that of the 25 ed-tech startups I covered, all but one were still in business (and that one had been acquired by Amazon).</p>
<p>Those companies: <a href="http://kno.com">Kno</a>, <a href="http://grockit.com">Grockit</a>, <a href="http://quora.com">Quora</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://mahalo.com">Mahalo</a>, <a href="http://inkling.com">Inkling</a>, <a href="http://udemy.com">Udemy</a>, <a href="http://studyblue.com">StudyBlue</a>, <a href="http://inigral.com">Inigral</a>, <a href="http://instructure.com">Instructure</a>, <a href="http://schoology.com">Schoology</a>, <a href="http://highlighter.com/">Highlighter</a>, <a href="http://babbel.com">Babbel</a>, Teachstreet, <a href="http://www.rsed.org/">Rocketship</a>, <a href="http://meegenius.com">MeeGenius</a>, <a href="http://internmatch.com">Internmatch</a>, <a href="http://openstudy.com">Open Study</a>, <a href="http://learnboost.com">LearnBoost</a>, MiniMonos, <a href="http://DonorsChoose.org">DonorsChoose.org</a>, <a href="http://triplingo.com">TripLingo</a>, <a href="http://stencyl.com">Stencyl</a>, <a href="http://researchgate.com">ResearchGate</a>, <a href="http://neverware.com">Neverware</a>, and <a href="http://gazziliworld.com/">GoodieWords</a>.<br /><br />One year later, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApOobZWAkwW4dGRoWXZPbGdaaVljaWE4T2hoSTdDQUE&amp;usp=sharing">it&rsquo;s a pretty different story</a>. 5 of those companies have now been acquired. Two pivoted away from education. Several rebranded. One is dead. A couple are mere shells, seemingly kept alive by a single developer. Some people are less than transparent about what&rsquo;s happening to their company (doesn&rsquo;t really encourage folks to trust you, but hey&hellip;). Founders have left about half of these startups. The venture capital continues to flow to a handful. (Here's a link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApOobZWAkwW4dGRoWXZPbGdaaVljaWE4T2hoSTdDQUE&amp;usp=sharing">a Google spreadsheet</a> with the details about various updates.)<br /><br />As I note in <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/03/20/2010-2011-ed-tech-startups-updated/">that original article</a>, and I&rsquo;ll reiterate here, these startups aren&rsquo;t a great sampling of what was happening circa 2010. I was discouraged from writing about ed-tech when I worked for RWW (it&rsquo;s why I founded Hack Education), and I had to choose my stories carefully. <br /><br />Founded around roughly the same time, for example: <a href="http://www.knewton.com/">Knewton</a> (going gangbusters as it crafts the narrative about what we mean by &ldquo;adaptive learning"), <a href="http://2u.com/">2U</a> (just IPO&rsquo;d), <a href="http://livemocha.com/">Livemocha</a> (acquired by Rosetta Stone), <a href="http://www.tenmarks.com/">TenMarks</a> (acquired by Amazon), <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> (not only math-messianic but oh so flush with cash), the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/09/14/imagine-k12-graduates-its-first-class-of-ed-tech-startups/">first cohort of the education startup incubator ImagineK12</a>, and <a href="https://www.edmodo.com/">Edmodo</a>.</p>
<h2>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night...</h2>
<p>Ah Edmodo. This is the one to watch, I think. The company has raised about $40 million in venture capital. Its last round of funding, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edmodo">according to Crunchbase</a>, was 2012. Since then, there have been leadership changes: <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-03-20-leaning-in-at-edmodo">a new CEO</a> Crystal Hutter (incidentally, married to Rob Hutter, a partner at Learn Capital, one of Edmodo&rsquo;s investors. I&rsquo;m not sure what role founders Nic Borg and Jeff O&rsquo;Hara play any longer.) And while the company can tout an ever-growing number of users (not active users, mind you. users), what it can&rsquo;t boast &mdash; at least from what I can tell &mdash; is a path to profitability. The company, which still offers its core product for free, has tried a number of premium features &mdash; wholesaling apps via an app store and a <a href="https://blog.edmodo.com/2014/06/30/snapshot-can-now-make-schools-and-districts-anything-but-standard/">premium analytics feature</a> for districts. <br /><br />And I dunno. Maybe it can eek out enough revenue to support the 110+ employees on &ldquo;<a href="https://www.edmodo.com/about">the team</a>.&rdquo; Maybe Edmodo is &ldquo;too big to fail.&rdquo; It does, after all, represent what has been the mantra I&rsquo;ve heard investors preach to so many startup founders: Make your product free. Pitch to teachers. Avoid district bureaucracy. Grow big. Then raise VC. Sell to districts eventually, using your star teachers as leverage, particularly via social media. It&rsquo;ll all work out. <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/software/udacity-ceo-says-mooc-magic-formula-emerging/d/d-id/1111221">Magic formula</a>. And such. <br /><br />Do we keep telling this story? Do we keep ed-tech startups in business in order to keep telling this story?<br /><br />Or perhaps, before we lose more smart and kind founders like Mike Lee from ed-tech because they start to realize it's mostly frustrating bullshit, we can have some honest conversations about what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not working in the business of ed-tech.</p>
