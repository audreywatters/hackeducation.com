<p>Alice Bell is working on a research project with the Open University&rsquo;s <a href="http://www8.open.ac.uk/iet/main/">Institute of Educational Technology</a> &ldquo;exploring communities of education blogging.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s posted a questionaire <a href="http://alicerosebell.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/research-education-bloggers/">on her blog</a>, and I&rsquo;m posting my answers below. (Deadline for responses is June 15).</p>
<p><strong>Blog URL:</strong> <a href="http://hackeducation.com">http://hackeducation.com</a></p>
<p><strong>What do you blog about?</strong> Broadly, I blog about education technology. More specifically, I write about developments in the ed-tech industry; startups&rsquo; products and services; technology usage in and out of the classroom; how technologies (could) change the way we teach and learn; conferences and events I attend.</p>
<p><strong>Are you paid to blog?</strong> I am not paid to blog on Hack Education. I freelance <a href="http://insidehighered.com/">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do professionally (other than blog)?</strong> I blog professionally. I&rsquo;ve started doing some public speaking recently too.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you been blogging at this site?</strong> <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/06/05/hack-education-turns-2/">Two</a> years. I have been blogging elsewhere since 2005.</p>
<p><strong>Do you write in other platforms? (e.g. in a print magazine?)</strong> My work has appeared in ReadWriteWeb, the Huffington Post, O&rsquo;Reilly Radar, School Library Journal, Edutopia, KQED Mindshift &ndash; among other blogs. Once upon a time, when I was in grad school, I had several academic articles published in books and journals too. (See my <a href="http://audreywatters.com/cv.html">CV</a> for details.) I have an article forthcoming in a real live print magazine this fall.</p>
<p><strong>Can you remember why you started blogging?</strong> When I started in 2005, I was a grad student and at the time, I blogged pseudonymously. I wrote about personal, political and PhD-oriented topics &ndash; dissertations, teaching, cancer, death, parenthood and other struggles.</p>
<p><strong>What keeps you blogging?</strong> Writing helps me organize my thoughts. I consider Hack Education my own personal-yet-public notebook of ideas and analysis. I choose topics to write about because they&rsquo;re timely, important, interesting &ndash; but mostly it&rsquo;s because I want to spend some time thinking through them. What I love about blogging &ndash; other than just the good habits that it cultivates in prompting me to write regularly and write often &ndash; is that there&rsquo;s an audience that gives me immediate feedback. In other words, blogging is a first stab at working through ideas, and when I hit publish, I can bounce those ideas off of others. Plus I&rsquo;m getting old too &ndash; if I don&rsquo;t write things down, I forget them. Also, if I bottled up all these rants, my blood pressure would go through the roof.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any idea of the size or character if your audience? How?</strong> I have Google Analytics installed on this blog, but I don&rsquo;t really pay much attention to pageviews. I really don&rsquo;t like the way in which a lot of online publications chase pageviews. But based on Google Analytics numbers, my blog gets about 50,000&ndash;60,000 pageviews a month. I also have about 11k Twitter followers (on @audreywatters, but less than 2000 on @hackeducation) which I see as part of my blog/writing audience. Who exactly this audience is &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure. Educators mostly. Entrepreneurs, I think. The Department of Education, perhaps. (Ha.) My mom.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your attitude to/ relationship with people who comment on your blog?</strong> I think I spend more time engaging with my audience via Twitter than via blog comments. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t value commenters; it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t squeal out loud when folks like Nicholas Negroponte comment. It&rsquo;s just that some of my most popular stories tend to <a href="/2011/10/28/codecademy-and-the-future-of-not-learning-to-code/">bring out the trolls</a>. After a while, I don&rsquo;t even read the comments on those posts. I just can&rsquo;t bear to.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel as if you fit into any particular community, network or genre of blogging? (e.g. schools, science, education, museums, technology)</strong> Sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m part of the education, ed-tech, and/or tech communities. Sometimes I feel like I stand on the outskirts of all of them. The question of genre is an interesting one. I don&rsquo;t know how my writing fits in generically. I don&rsquo;t write that many short, newsy posts. I avoid list posts. I write a few product reviews, I guess. But I tend to ground my stories in personal experience and opinion. That&rsquo;s one aspect of the blog genre, and one of its earliest expressions. But as blogging has become more accepted, I&rsquo;m not sure if that personal style of writing is as common.</p>
<p><strong>If so, what does that community give you?</strong> I learn a lot from what others say, do, and write online. I appreciate it when folks say they like what I&rsquo;m doing as a writer. I think about the education community in particular as both the audience and the reason that I do this.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think are the advantages of blogging? What are its disadvantages/ limitations?</strong> <em>The advantages:</em> Blogging has given me a voice and a platform that I wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have. I write. People listen. People pay me (elsewhere) to write. I love the immediacy of of blogging &ndash; writing and publishing and sharing my thoughts, then hearing responses and seeing the retweets immediately from my readers. It&rsquo;s also incredibly important to me that what I write on my blog is freely available and openly licensed, indexed by search engines, and much more discoverable than what I&rsquo;ve published in print. <em>The disadvantages:</em> I haven&rsquo;t found the time yet to develop my ideas into a book-length format, probably because I&rsquo;m so busy writing short pieces on my blog. Also, I&rsquo;m not sure people take me seriously as a writer, a journalist, a social commentator or an analyst. I&rsquo;m &ldquo;just a blogger.&rdquo; <em>Also:</em> <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Bloggers-Need-Not-Apply/45022/">Screw you Ivan Tribble</a>. I&rsquo;ll never stop writing publicly about academia.</p>
<p><strong>Do you tell people you know offline that you&rsquo;re a blogger? (e.g. your grandmother, your boss)</strong> I describe myself as a writer. I&rsquo;m not sure I use the term &ldquo;blogger.&rdquo; Sometimes I say &ldquo;journalist.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you want to tell me about I haven&rsquo;t asked?</strong> Well, I have questions that I&rsquo;d like to know about other education bloggers: where do you syndicate your work (me, I post to Twitter, to Facebook &ndash; a fan page for Hack Education and to my own profile, to Google+). Do you offer RSS and/or email subscriptions? (I offer both). Do you have an email newsletter? (<a href="http://eepurl.com/l-yJz">I just started offering one</a>). And mostly, I&rsquo;m hoping the results of this research are made available as I&rsquo;m really curious about others&rsquo; answers to these questions.</p>
