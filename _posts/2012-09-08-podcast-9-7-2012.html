<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week. Luckily for me then, we actually chatted several times this week, recording a podcast on <a href="/2012/09/04/podcast-9-3-2012/">Monday</a>, participating in a <a href="/2012/09/06/elsewhere/">webinar</a> together on Thursday, and recording another podcast episode yesterday.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time in this one talking about education startups -- the Ed Startup 101 class I'm taking, the startups that I "<a href="/2012/09/06/top-10-ed-tech-startups-of-2011-updated/">love</a>," whether or not Hack Education itself is a startup, and how I plan to make this venture a financially sustainable one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also talk about the national party conventions and their rhetoric about education, contrasting that with Steve's plans for a <a href="http://www.stevehargadon.com/2012/09/the-hack-your-education-city-by-city.html">"Hack Your Education" tour</a> which he kicks off this week.</p>
