<blockquote>
<p>Employing the universe of juvenile court decisions in a U.S. state between 1996 and 2012, we analyze the effects of emotional shocks associated with <strong>unexpected outcomes of football games</strong> played by a prominent college team in the state. We investigate the <strong>behavior of judges</strong>, the conduct of whom should, by law, be free of personal biases and emotions. We find that unexpected losses increase disposition (sentence) lengths assigned by judges during the week following the game. Unexpected wins, or losses that were expected to be close contests ex-ante, have no impact. <strong>The effects of these emotional shocks are asymmetrically borne by black defendants</strong>.</p>
