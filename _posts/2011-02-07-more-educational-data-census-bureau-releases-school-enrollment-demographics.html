<p>The U.S. Census Bureau has released new data on <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/school/cps2009.html">school enrollment</a>.  The information comes from the Current Population Survey, a statistical survey that the Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics administer.</p>
<p>The data, which is available to download, is from 2009, but the historical tables available in some of the reports go back as far as 1956.  The tables include details about school enrollment status for the population over age 3, with breakdowns by sex, age, race, and nationality.  There's also information about family income, high school graduation rates, college enrollment, and employment of those in vocational courses.</p>
