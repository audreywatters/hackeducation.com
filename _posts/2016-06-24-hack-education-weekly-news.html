<p>I watched the results roll in from the <strong>Brexit</strong> referendum last night with great, great sadness. My mum is British, and I&#8217;ve always joked that my British passport is one of my most prized possessions. I am gravely concerned for the future of my youngest family members, who&#8217;ve had their futures immeasurably altered by this election. I&#8217;m gravely concerned for all our futures frankly, as a xenophobic populism, blended with a neoliberal greed, sweeps the West. I suppose I&#8217;ll save the rest of this rant for <a href="http://tinyletter.com/audreywatters">my newsletter</a>&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/06/24/brexit-win-universities-face-significant-challenges">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;British citizens voted on Thursday for the <strong>United Kingdom</strong> to leave the <strong>European Union</strong>, ushering in a period of uncertainty for universities. The margin was 52 to 48 percent. Many in higher education opposed a British exit, or Brexit, from the union, arguing that membership in the E.U. helps enable international research collaborations and that free movement across member states helps U.K. universities attract top scholars and students.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/As-U-of-Louisville-s/236861">Via The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>: &#8220;With two executive orders, Gov. Matt Bevin of <strong>Kentucky</strong> has thrown the leadership and governance of the <strong>University of Louisville</strong> into chaos. The governor, a Republican elected in 2015, announced on Friday that he had disbanded the university&#8217;s current 20-member Board of Trustees. He has put in place a six-member interim board to oversee the institution, with three new appointees and the current faculty, staff, and student representatives.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>President Obama</strong> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-obama-anti-business-president/">might become</a> a <strong>venture capitalist</strong> after leaving office. (That&#8217;s what former Department of Education folks, Arne Duncan and Jim Shelton, have done. And of course current Undersecretary of Education, Ted Mitchell, is a former VC.) Bonus points if former British PM David Cameron becomes one too.</p>

They returned a syllabus that was all-white in composition &#8211; not just in that the primary authors of the books selected contained no people of color but the books themselves largely avoided America's colonial-settler, chattel-slavery, and racist-imperial history.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <strong>U.S. Supreme Court</strong> on Thursday upheld the <strong>University of Texas at Austin</strong>&#8216;s consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions. Some parts of the decision in the case, <strong>Fisher v.

Texas. That means the ruling of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stands &#8211; which had kept the programs (known as DAPA and DACA+) from going into effect.&#8221; (The decision raises some questions about educational benefits extended to &#8220;Dreamers.&#8221;)</p>
