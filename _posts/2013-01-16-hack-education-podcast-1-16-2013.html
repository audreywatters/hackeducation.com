<p>I'm&nbsp;<a href="/2013/01/14/update/">writing a book</a> this year, and as such I'm going to blog less. But I don't think that's going to affect the podcast that Steve Hargadon and I record weekly(ish).</p>
<p>We'll continue to record it weekly(ish) as I really do find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have. As I try to pull my thoughts on ed-tech together for blogging and for book-writing, this is ever-so-important for me as I think and talk and write through ideas about the future of learning.</p>
<p>Steve and I chatted today for the first time in 2013. As such, we caught up on a couple of weeks' worth of news and blog posts and such. We had a great conversation about hedgehogs and foxes and Aaron Swartz and open data and technology freedom and robots and Seymour Papert and AI and politics and stuff.&nbsp;</p>
