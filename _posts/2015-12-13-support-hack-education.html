<p>I&#8217;m halfway through my year-end review of (what I think are) <a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com">the important trends in education technology in 2015</a>.</p>

<p>The word count for the series so far hovers around 34,000, and I have a lot more to say. (I'm sorry. You're welcome.)</p>

<p>This project is a substantial undertaking, but I think it&#8217;s worthwhile compiling an overview and analysis of &#8220;what happened,&#8221; particularly as the education technology industry and the ed-tech press seem prone to forget the past so quickly.</p>

<p>I learn an incredible amount in the process of writing this series, and I see things that I might not otherwise. I hope that, in turn, the series offers the same to my readers.</p>

<p>So with that in mind, I&#8217;d like to remind folks that you can <strong><a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">support my work</a></strong> financially. You can do so by inviting me to speak (um, and paying me to speak), <a href="http://audreywatters.com/books/">buying my books</a>, and/or <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">making a donation</a>.</p>

<p>I purposefully keep Hack Education advertising-free. Unlike many other technology blogs, Hack Education isn&#8217;t owned by a major technology or media or for-profit education company. I don&#8217;t take sponsorship dollars to promote certain posts or products. I have not taken investment money from the same venture capitalists who fund education/technology companies. I think venture philanthropy in education is one of the most dangerous threats to democracy, and so there&#8217;ll be no Gates Foundation or Zuckerberg-Chan grants for me. </p>

<p>I am one of the very few independent voices in ed-tech media.</p>

<p>To those who have supported my work &#8211; whether financially or intellectually &#8211; I cannot begin to tell you how much I appreciate you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I really could not do this without you.</p>
