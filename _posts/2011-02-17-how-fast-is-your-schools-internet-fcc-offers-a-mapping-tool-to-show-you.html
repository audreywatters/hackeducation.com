<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the FCC launched <a href="http://broadbandmap.gov/">Broadbandmap.gov</a>, the National Broadband Map.</p>
<p>The map is a searchable website with over 25 million records, allowing users to view the availability and speed of broadband across the country -- something that according to the <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Commentary/2010/February/FCC-Broadband-Adoption-and-Use-in-America.aspx">Pew Internet and American Life Project</a> is on the rise but still something that only about 65% of Americans have.</p>
<p>The Obama Administration has highlighted the importance of broadband access to economic growth with its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/plan/">National Broadband Plan</a>.  But broadband is also a key piece of our education infrastructure.  A recent FCC survey among schools and libraries found that <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/fcc_report_finds_better_broadband_needed_for_schoo.php">80%</a> of institutions did not have broadband connections that met their needs.</p>

<p>The data in the new National Broadband Map is crowdsourced, and you can give feedback about the data (or lack of data) provided. (One note:  the data, so far, only lists the advertised broadband speed from local providers, <em>not</em> the actual speed as shown via testing.)  The data here will probably help provide the roadmap for the government as it moves to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/fcc_to_reshape_phone_subsidy_program_to_help_boost.php">divert funding</a> from supporting telephone infrastructure to supporting broadband implementation.</p>
<p>How does your school or library stack up?</p>
