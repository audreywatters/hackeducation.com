<p>Applications will open soon for Google <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a>, a global program that gives college CS students an opportunity (with a stipend) to do real-work development on <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/open-source/">open source</a> projects.   On Friday, Google <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/03/mentoring-organizations-for-google.html">announced</a> the 175 mentoring organizations for this summer's program.</p>
<p>You can see the full list <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2011">here</a>, which will give you an idea of the sorts of projects these organizations are interested in.  <a href="http://www.moodle.org">Moodle</a>, for example, is looking for PHP developers and is interested in <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Projects_for_new_developers">report generators and spam filters</a>.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/catroid/wiki/IdeasPage">Catroid</a>, a programming language for Android inspired by <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, is looking for developers to help build out its functionality.</p>
<p>If you're a student interested in applying for the Summer of Code program, you should have a look at this list in order to help you prepare.  Even though applications don't open until March 28, you should contact the organizations you'd like to work with <em>now</em>.  Many are open to suggestions for other project ideas too.</p>
