<p>Hack Education turns 8 years old today. I&#8217;d registered the domain a few days earlier back in 2010, but on this day, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2010/06/05/why-hack-education">I wrote my first article</a> here. I think my boyfriend rolled his eyes. "Good luck," he said. (Funny, 8 years later, he is still my boyfriend.)</p>

<p>For the past 8 years, I have supported myself through this site, thanks in no small part to the encouragement and financial support of my readers. I have never wanted to scale via venture capital. I have never accepted sponsorship dollars to pay for me to promote certain products or policies. I don&#8217;t advertise. I don&#8217;t consult. I don&#8217;t have a full-time gig that enables me to write about education technology as part of my job description. Hack Education is here because I&#8217;ve decided to devote myself to it&#8230; and somewhere along the way, folks have decided it was worth keeping (me) around. They&#8217;ve <a href="http://audreywatters.com/cv/speaking">invited me to speak</a> and allowed me to publish the transcript of my talks here. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">They&#8217;ve contributed to this work via PayPal or Patreon</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>

<p>I can&#8217;t really boast about how many readers this site has had over the years &#8211; I don&#8217;t believe in tracking that number because I think analytics are suspect at best, surveillance capitalism at worst. I can&#8217;t tell you how many articles I&#8217;ve published because frankly I&#8217;m too lazy to count.</p>

<p>But I am pretty glad that I get to do what I do: that is, write about education technology and the history of the future of edcuation. I still firmly believe all this is key to understanding the past, present, and future of education (and even of computing technologies more broadly). As it is so goddamn crucial, I suppose that means there are a couple more years left in this website before all this "blogging thing" has run its course....</p>
