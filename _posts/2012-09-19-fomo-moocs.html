<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/coursera150.jpeg" alt="" align="right" />It&rsquo;s that feeling of anxiety that you get when you look on Twitter and see all your colleagues are headed out to conferences, concerts, parties, or movies. If you don&rsquo;t go, you worry, if you don&rsquo;t do&nbsp;<em>something</em>, if you don&rsquo;t have your own status updates and Instagram photos to share, opportunities are going to pass you by.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;fear of missing out&rdquo; or FOMO, the social pressure that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alone-Together-Expect-Technology-Other/dp/0465010210">Sherry Turkle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://caterina.net/2011/03/15/fomo-and-social-media/">others</a>&nbsp;argue is an increasingly powerful side effect of our increasingly &ldquo;connected&rdquo; worlds.</p>
<p>17 new universities&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/09/19/coursera-doubles-university-partnerships">announced partnerships</a>&nbsp;with the online education startup&nbsp;<a href="http://coursera.com/">Coursera</a>&nbsp;today, doubling the number of institutions now offering courses on the platform. And I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if this is another form of FOMO.</p>
<p>You can certainly sense it in&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/education/coursera-adds-more-ivy-league-partner-universities.html">The New York Times</a></em>&nbsp;write-up of the news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The caliber of Coursera&rsquo;s partners &mdash; Princeton, Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania were among the original partners &mdash; has given it credibility and cachet in higher education circles, so much so that&nbsp;<strong>some university presidents have begun to fret that it will reflect badly on them if they fail to sign on</strong>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re known by your partners, and this is the College of Cardinals,&rdquo; said E. Gordon Gee, the president of Ohio State, one of the new partners. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s some of the best universities in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gee, whose university will offer two courses from its College of Pharmacy, said he had some concerns about giving away content with no revenue stream in sight.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That does keep me up at night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing this in the hope and expectation that we&rsquo;ll be able to build a financial model, but I don&rsquo;t know what it is. But we can&rsquo;t be too far behind in an area that&rsquo;s growing and changing as fast as this one.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;(emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can&rsquo;t fall behind. We can&rsquo;t be left out.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to suggest that fear is the only thing motivating universities to hop on the MOOC bandwagon. It&rsquo;s not to say that the experiments with massive online education aren&rsquo;t something that universities should explore.</p>
<p>But it does feel as though the rush for institutions to join Coursera isn&rsquo;t just a matter of their recognizing potential for these kinds of classes to reshape higher education. In the midst of all the hype and the hoopla, it&rsquo;s FOMO. The fear of missing out. Indeed as Coursera co-founder Andrew Ng tells&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/09/19/coursera-doubles-university-partnerships">Inside Higher Ed</a>,</em>&nbsp;the startup will "probably double its university partnerships at least one more time before it stops recruiting new institutions.&rdquo; So hurry, folks. You don&rsquo;t want to miss out&hellip;</p>
