<p><em>This is not the history of the phrase "education technology." But someone should write that...</em></p>

<p>Ed-tech. Is it short for &#8220;education technology&#8221; or &#8220;educational technology&#8221;? And really, what&#8217;s the difference?</p>

<p>Does &#8220;ed-tech&#8221; mean &#8220;instructional technology,&#8221; or does it refer to &#8220;learning technologies&#8221;? (Look at that previous sentence. One phrase is singular; one is plural. Hmm.) Could you just as easily &#8211; a nod to another decade &#8211; call it &#8220;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/11/04/programmed-instruction-versus-the-programmable-web/">programmed instruction</a>&#8221; instead? Or has all that been rebranded now to &#8220;<a href="https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2015/06/09/palimpsest-of-school-reform-personalized-learning/">personalized learning</a>&#8221;? If you push for &#8220;personalized learning,&#8221; do you advocate for CAI or CMI (or neither)? If you don't know what those acronyms mean, what then?</p>

<p>CAI or ICT? Or something else?</p>

<p>And how is that different from e-learning? Distance learning? Online learning? Mobile learning? Blended learning? Virtual learning? Or hey, run through all those terms again but substitute &#8220;teaching&#8221; for &#8220;learning&#8221; &#8211; teaching machines or learning machines or hell, whatever, as long as the machines are schooling us. Right?</p>

<p>Do you hyphenate &#8220;ed-tech&#8221;? Or have you decided that the hyphen is no longer necessary: it&#8217;s &#8220;edtech&#8221; now, Edsurge insists in an article modestly titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1783557/edsurge-new-lexicon-edtech">Edsurge: the New Lexicon of Edtech</a>.&#8221; Or is it &#8220;EdTech&#8221;? Capital E, capital T because this is So Important.</p>

<p>What counts as &#8220;ed-tech&#8221;? Is it the technology used in a formal educational setting? If it&#8217;s used in an informal setting, when does it become more than &#8220;consumer tech&#8221;? How has "the consumer" shaped what "the learner" now expects from "ed-tech," even in school?</p>

<p>Is "ed-tech" the technology used in the central office? Or is it the technology used in the classroom? Ed-tech as teaching machine, ed-tech as testing machine, ed-tech as tutoring machine &#8211; wait, why machines?</p>

<p>Which machines? Which technologies? The textbook? Then mechanical pencil? The radio? The TV? The PA system? The blackboard? The whiteboard? The computer? The app? The very most latest technological "innovation"?</p>

<p>Or are you one of those folks who insists that it is not about the technology &#8211; despite that word &#8220;technology&#8221; being right there in &#8220;ed-tech&#8221;? If so, what makes the tech so darn fabulously transformatively educational - to the point you'd argue the tech should be invisible?</p>

<p>Like everything in ed-tech, these concerns are not new. I stumbled across an essay from 1973 tonight about what to call this "ed-tech" "thing" by Charles W. Slack: &#8220;How to Name Our Baby&#8221;. (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/status/609915025323528192">Slack is interesting for so many other reasons too</a>.) He argues that,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Educational movements of the last decade have been hampered by absolutely <em>awful</em> vocabularies: &#8220;teaching machines,&#8221; &#8220;intrinsic programming, &#8221;programmed instruction,&#8220; &#8221;operant conditioning,&#8220; &#8221;behavioral objectives,&#8220; &#8221;contingency management,&#8220; &#8221;systems approach,&#8220; &#8221;linear programming,&#8220; &#8221;rul-eg,&#8220; &#8221;pro-mod,&#8220; &#8221;frame-up,&#8220; &#8221;schedules of reinforcement,&#8220; &#8221;mathetics,&#8220; &#8221;chaining,&#8220; &#8221;discrimination,&quot; and on and <em>on</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the vocabulary is not the problem that "hampers" us, truth be told, although I do think that the incoherence tells us something &#8211; something that shouldn&#8217;t be erased or paved over with some enforced, "shared" terminology. That is: those of us who work in and around and near ed-tech do not agree at all about politics, purpose, function, future, funding, labor, learning. Different words and phrasing are okay, instructive even.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m keeping the hyphen in ed-tech, by the way. I like that little dash that separates education from technology. Because I don&#8217;t think we need to give ourselves over to a future of mechanized education, of teaching <em>or</em> learning machines (let alone one of uncritical and purposefully branded neologisms)...</p>
