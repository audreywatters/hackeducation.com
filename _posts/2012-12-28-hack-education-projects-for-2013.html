<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year. Review what I&rsquo;ve done. Think about what I want to do next. Make note of what remains undone and incomplete before I take on new projects in the new year.</p>
<p>Here, in no particular order, are the projects I have on my plate for the upcoming months:</p>
<h2>Ed-Tech Guide</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been (more or less) quietly working away at a <a href="http://guide.hackeducation.com/">guide</a> to support &ldquo;<a href="/2012/03/17/what-every-techie-should-know-about-education/">the Audrey tests</a>&rdquo; &mdash; that is, what every educator should know about the tech industry and what every edu-entrepreneur/engineer should know about education. I plan to continue pulling together articles to feature in it, as well as writing more content.</p>
<h2>Ed-Tech TOS</h2>
<p>Following the recent hullaballoo over <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/what-instagrams-new-terms-of-service-mean-for-you/">changes to Instagram&rsquo;s Terms of Service</a>, I asked on Twitter if educators had been prompted to revisit and review the TOS for the various ed-tech tools they use. The response: nope. Ouch. But I think this is an incredibly important issue: who owns your data? who owns your students&rsquo; data? what rights are you signing away? what licenses are you granting companies for your user-generated content when you click that "I agree" button? So I plan to contribute to the <a href="http://tos-dr.info/">Terms of Service; Didn&rsquo;t Read</a> project and help add information and a little clarity about <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/10/24/tos-tl-dr/">various ed-tech companies&rsquo; terms</a>.</p>
<h2>Education History Book Group</h2>
<p>I talked a lot in 2012 about how we <a href="/2012/11/01/history-of-education-khan-academy/">ignore education history</a>, and to that end <a href="http://budtheteacher.com/blog/2012/11/05/so-lets-start-an-eduhistory-book-club-then/">Bud Hunt and I</a> have discussed having an #eduhistory book group where we work our way through various historical texts. We still need to set a date to hold our first Google Hangout (or whatever tool we decide on) where we&rsquo;ll discuss the <a href="http://archive.org/details/cu31924030593580">Committee of Ten Report</a>.</p>
<h2>Ed-Tech Crunchbase</h2>
<p>Recently I tweeted that I&rsquo;d like to see more better data (read: open data and an API) regarding ed-tech companies&rsquo; and venture capitalists&rsquo; funding &mdash; an education version of <a href="http://crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a>, if you will. I wrote a <a href="/2012/10/10/ed-tech-investors/">post</a> back in October where I started to detail some VCs&rsquo; portfolios, but a blog post isn&rsquo;t the right place to keep this info up-to-date. I&rsquo;m also interested to see how this funding might connect to the <a href="/2012/12/19/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-politics-of-ed-tech/">politics of ed-tech</a> &mdash; lobbying efforts, <a href="/2012/10/08/alec-and-ed-tech/">ALEC</a>, and the like. And it only seems right that non-profits like the Gates Foundation be included here too. (This would be a pretty massive undertaking though, so I think I&rsquo;d rather <em>write</em> about a project like this than actually, ya know, <em>build</em> it.)</p>
<h2>Long-Form Writing</h2>
<p>Since there&rsquo;s plenty of (ed-)tech churnalism out there already &mdash; the simple copy-and-pasting of companies&rsquo; press releases that fills most of the tech-blogosphere &mdash; and more than enough <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2012/11/25/top-100-reasons-why-i-hate-list-posts/">link-baity-list posts</a> &mdash; &ldquo;Top 422 iPad Apps to Use In Your Classroom Today!&rdquo; &mdash; I plan to continue my focus on writing longer, more in-depth, (hopefully!) more thoughtful pieces here on Hack Education. (At the moment, I only have one outlet for whom I freelance regularly &mdash; <a href="http://insidehighered.com">Inside Higher Ed</a>. I&rsquo;d like to find another publication, one that&rsquo;s more &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; &mdash; that is, neither specifically &ldquo;tech&rdquo; or &ldquo;ed.&rdquo; But then again, I'd love to just focus on Hack Education.)</p>
<h2>A Book</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna write a book in 2013. Really. I feel like this year might be my last chance before <a href="http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/13/patented-book-writing-system-lets-one-professor-create-hundreds-of-thousands-of-amazon-books-and-counting/">the robots replace us writers</a>.</p>
