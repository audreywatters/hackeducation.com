<p>Much like the move to <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/12/06/the-year-in-ed-tech-part-3-mobile-learning/">mobile</a>, 2010 saw an increase in the adoption of social networking -- across the board (clearly) with <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_halfway_to_1_billion_users.php">Facebook gaining its 500 millionth user</a> this year, but also specifically in education, where social networking has been viewed with some suspicion by those who associate it with security and privacy risks.</p>
<p>While sites like Facebook may be blocked at some schools, it doesn't stop students from using it off-campus to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_messaging_teens_and_school_work_can_faceb.php">chat about homework assignments</a>.  But several companies, such as <a href="http://www.schoology.com">Schoology</a> and <a href="http://www.edmodo.com">Edmodo</a> have taken some of the functionality of a Facebook-like site and applied it to the learning management system, providing a way for schools to build social networks more geared towards the academic setting.</p>
<p>In no small part because of the ongoing <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_facebook_is_wrong_about_privacy.php">privacy concerns</a> surrounding Facebook, many educators had turned to <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> as an alternative site in which to build their own private social networks.  However, Ning announced in April that it would be changing its business model and ending its "<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/no_free_lunch_for_ning_users.php">freemium</a>" offerings.  Following an outcry from many educators, Ning announced that it would continue to offer <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/ning_announces_new_pricing_model_free_nings_for_te.php">some free version</a> of the new "Ning Mini" to teachers, subsidized by the publisher <a href="http://blog.ning.com/2010/06/pearson-to-provide-ning-mini-for-free-to-educators.html">Pearson</a>.</p>
<p>And while a study of undergraduates' use of technology found that <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/survey_finds_college_students_love_laptops_but_not.php">very few students utilized Twitter</a>, the microblogging platform has become an important site nonetheless for many educators (and some students) in the development of real-time personal learning networks.  A report released today by the Pew Internet and American Life Project finds that <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Media-Mentions/2010/Pew-says-8-of-American-adults-who-use-Internet-are-Twitter-users.aspx">8% of Americans use Twitter</a>, with those between the ages of 18 and 29 significantly more likely to do so.</p>
<p>While one study has argued that <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/11/21/research-on-social-networking-and-learning-the-good-the-bad-and-the-headlines/">Twitter helps improve students' grades and engagement</a>, that argument could probably be made about any number of new technologies that work to connect students and teachers with real-time collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>But against the move towards more adoption of social networks has come a backlash about the way in which the Internet may also facilitate "cyberbullying."  Particularly following a string of suicides of gay youth, many decried the ways in which these technologies make it easier for threats and violence to occur. As <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2010/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-cyberbullying.html">Anil Dash</a>, <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/04/07/cyberbullying.html">danah boyd</a>, and others argue, it's unwise to blame the technology and not examine closely the societal and cultural beliefs that actually lead to that sort of bullying.</p>
<p>Indeed, both the spread of social networking and the fears it elicits have made the teaching about digital citizenship the more important, and many schools are working to re-examine not just their "acceptable use" policies in terms of new devices and new connectivity, but also to help students understand how to live and learn in a digital world.</p>
