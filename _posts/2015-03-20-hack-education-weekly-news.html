<h3>Schools and Surveillance</h3>
<br />
<p>Former Newark Star-Ledger reporter Bob Braun <a href="http://www.bobbraunsledger.com/breaking-pearson-nj-spying-on-social-media-of-students-taking-parcc-tests/">posted a photo of an email</a> sent by a school superintendent this week, revealing that Pearson was actively monitoring students&#8217; social media during PARCC exams. Cue: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2015/03/14/pearson-monitoring-social-media-for-security-breaches-during-parcc-testing/">panic and mayhem</a>. I wrote about this at length <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/03/17/pearson-spy/">here</a>. In his original story, Braun revealed the full details of this (female) superintendent&#8217;s name and contact information (phone number and email address). Later this week, in making very spurious connections between a different NJDOE official, Pearson, and the open source database company MongoDB, Braun doxxed that (female) NJDOE official. I called out via Twitter those who decided to spread this information, but according to some [not going to link because I&#8217;m working on my response], doxxing (women?) you disagree with in education politics is totally a-okay. Good work. education sector. Way to raise the bar in your efforts to protect student privacy.</p>

<p>But anyways, perhaps not the best timing for a Pearson blog post titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.pearsoned.com/education-blog/getting-inside-students-heads/">Getting Inside Students&#8217; Heads</a>.&#8221; Or this industry-backed op-ed in Edsurge: &#8220;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-03-16-why-opting-out-of-student-data-collection-isn-t-the-solution">Why Opting Out of Student Data Collection Isn’t the Solution</a>.&#8221;<br>

<p>Phil Hill offers a <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/rutgers-and-proctortrack-fiasco-impact-of-listening-to-regulations-but-not-students/">round-up of news and analysis</a> about Rutgers University and ProctorTrack, &#8220;which costs students $32 in additional fees, accessing their personal webcams, automatically tracks face and knuckle video as well as watching browser activity.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;<strong>Student privacy is a big issue, and students should have some input into the policies shaped by institutions</strong>.&#8221; (emphasis mine)</p>

<h3>Elsewhere in Education (Technology) Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>Fourth graders from Lincoln Akerman School in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire traveled to Concord to watch a bill they&#8217;d written be debated. They wanted to see the red-tail hawk be made the state&#8217;s raptor. Instead, they were witness to adults being awful, with <a href="http://www.people.com/article/new-hampshire-lawmakers-kill-red-tailed-hawk-bill">Rep. Warren Groen comparing the bird to Planned Parenthood and its support for abortion</a>. Good work, democracy.</p>
