<p>When I heard that Facebook was going to make a "big announcement" about its messaging system, with rumors that it would be launching a web-based email platform closely integrated with Microsoft Office, I quickly contacted several educators (and Google) to get their thoughts on how this would play out for students and schools (and Google Apps for Edu).  Today's <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/live_blog_facebooks_email_announcement.php">announcement</a> was a little underwhelming.  And I'm not really sure there's a story there.  OK, I'm not really sure I feel like writing it tonight.  So... moving on...</p>

And students won't be turned over to the police.</p>
