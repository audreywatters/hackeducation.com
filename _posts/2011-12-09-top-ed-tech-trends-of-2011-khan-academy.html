<p><a href="http://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> wasn't new in 2011, but oh man, was it news.</p>

<p>Sal Khan has been creating his own videos to teach math and science for seven years now, but the mainstream media discovered Khan Academy in a big way this year. You'd be hard-pressed to find a major news organization that hasn't covered the non-profit: <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/07/ff_khan/all/1">Wired</a>. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7379221n">CBS News</a>. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1728471/change-generation-bill-gates-favorite-teacher-wants-to-disrupt-education">Fast Company</a>. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/khan-academy-triples-unique-users-to-3-5-million/">Techcrunch</a>. <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/12/behind-scenes-khan-academy">Mother Jones</a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/05/technology/khan-academy-blends-its-youtube-approach-with-classrooms.html">The New York Times</a>. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/faster-forward/post/qanda-khan-academy-founder-says-videos-can-help-teachers-students/2011/06/03/AGOu21HH_blog.html">The Washington Post</a>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJFKE8kyz7w">The Charlie Rose Show</a>. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/12/07/khan-academy-ponders-what-it-can-teach-higher-education-establishment">Inside Higher Ed</a>. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21529062">The Economist</a>. <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/11/khan-academys-physical-iteration/">KQED</a>. <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/16/salman-kahn-the-new-andrew-carnegie/">Time</a>. <a href="http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/can-virtual-classrooms-change-way-we-learn-0021888">Al Jazeera</a>. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/top_right/2011/08/salman_khan_founder_of_khan_academy.html">Slate</a>. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_22/b4230072816925.htm">Business Week</a>. <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/388279/june-02-2011/salman-khan">The Colbert Report</a>. Me. And so on.</p>

<p>Khan has received high praise, with the media labeling him the "<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_22/b4230072816925.htm">Math Messiah</a>." An "<a href="http://edreformer.com/2011/06/friday-edtech-roundup-9/">educational Moses</a>." The <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/16/salman-kahn-the-new-andrew-carnegie/">new Andrew Carnegie</a>." The guy who's going to "<a href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-11-05/tech/30363133_1_new-faculty-members-lectures-videos">blow up education</a>."</p>
<p>No doubt, Khan Academy is a great story: Sal Khan is an affable guy with 3 MIT degrees and an MBA from Harvard who initially just made videos to help tutor his cousins. A hedge fund manager, Khan quit that job in 2009 to found the non-profit Khan Academy, to focus on making the videos and to advocate for his larger vision.</p>
