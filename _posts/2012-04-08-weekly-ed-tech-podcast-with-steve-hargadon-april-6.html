<p><a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I have been recording our weekly podcast together for about four months now, talking our way through the ed-tech news and the articles I've written over the course of a week. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week, and it's something that helps me think through and articulate the various trends -- good and bad -- we're seeing in education.</p>
<p>I've just been posting the link to the podcast each week, along with how to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/edtechlive/hackeducation">subscribe to the feed</a> and/or find the podcast in iTunes, as part of Steve's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/edtechlive/id219875737">EdTechLive series</a>.  But I've had several requests to expand the information I put in these podcast posts, with links to the articles and/or books we've discussed as well as their respective time-stamps.</p>
