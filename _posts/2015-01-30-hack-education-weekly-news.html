<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong> Governor <strong>Scott Walker</strong> (and Republican presidential candidate hopeful) <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/01/28/wisconsin-looks-cut-higher-ed-300m-tries-give-something-return">announced</a> a <strong>$300 million budget cut</strong> to the state&#8217;s higher education system, couching it in terms of &#8220;independence.&#8221; He says that the plan will make universities &quot;do things that they have not traditionally done" &#8211; including <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/01/29/wisconsin-governor-faculty-should-teach-more-classes">require professors teach more classes</a> per semester.</p>

<p>President Obama is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/us/politics/obama-will-drop-proposal-to-end-529-college-savings-plans.html">backing away</a> from his proposal to end the <strong>"529" college savings accounts</strong>. The Chronicle of Higher Education looks at &#8220;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/151347/">who&#8217;s saving for college in 529 plans</a>.&#8221; (3% of families.)</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/01/federal_student-data-privacy_draft_bill.html">Education Week obtained a draft</a> of President Obama&#8217;s proposed &#8220;<strong>Student Digital Privacy Act</strong>&#8221; which has apparently been renamed to include the word &#8220;innovation.&#8221; &#8220;Unlike the California law, the draft version of the proposed federal bill obtained by Education Week does not contain an explicit prohibition on vendors amassing profiles of K&#8211;12 students for non-educational uses. Nor does the draft federal bill follow California&#8217;s approach of prohibiting vendors from collecting student information via an educational site, service, or application, then using that information to target advertising to students elsewhere.&#8221; Because innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Chicago Public Schools</strong> board member (and ed-tech investor) <strong>Deborah Quazzo</strong> faced <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/327441/cps-board-member-deborah-quazzo-faces-critics-person-colleagues-rush-defense">criticisms</a> at this week&#8217;s school board meeting over her investment portfolio. Companies she&#8217;s invested in have seen their business with the district triple since she was appointed to the board.</p>

<p>The Department of Education is <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150128/BLOGS02/150129798/feds-rattle-1-2-billion-saber-at-cps-over-lack-of-testing">threatening</a> to withhold some $1.2 billion in funding for <strong>Illinois</strong> and <strong>Chicago</strong> in response to CPS&#8217;s decision to only administer the new <strong>PARCC</strong> exam to 10% of district students. </p>

<p><strong>Louisiana</strong> Governor <strong>Bobby Jindal</strong> has <a href="http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/2015/01/30/just-in-jindal-issues-executive-order-on-parcc-tests/22603021/">signed an executive order</a> allowing parents to opt their children out of the <strong>PARCC</strong> exam.</p>

<p>According to the <strong>National Center for Education Statistics</strong> (<a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0115/morningeducation16905.html">via Politico</a>), &#8220;Federal revenues for public elementary and secondary education dropped by a whopping 21.5 percent in fiscal year 2012.&#8221; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/nations-per-pupil-k-12-funding-fell-for-second-consecutive-year-in-2012/2015/01/29/e9190ff6-a750-11e4-a7c2-03d37af98440_story.html?wprss=rss_education">Per pupil spending dropped</a> by 2.8%, as &#8220;schools across the country spent an average of <strong>$10,667 per student</strong>.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/01/29/3617031/deadly-force-in-texas-classrooms/">A proposed bill in <strong>Texas</strong></a> would allow teachers to use &#8220;force or <strong>deadly force</strong> on school property, on a school bus, or at a school-sponsored event in defense of the educator’s person or in defense of students of the school that employs the educator&#8221; &#8211; that is, to kill a student.</p>

<p>The <strong>Wyoming</strong> legislature is <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Wyoming-panel-weighs-bill-to-allow-guns-on-school-6044007.php">weighing a measure</a> to allow <strong>concealed weapons</strong> on school campuses.</p>

<p><a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/01/28/bill-would-teach-sex-abuse-education-in-schools/">Proposed legislation</a> in <strong>Colorado</strong> would teach schoolchildren about <strong>sex abuse</strong> (although it&#8217;s anticipated that Republicans in the legislature will kill the bill).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/01/29/ky-computer-code-as-foreign-language/22529629/">A proposed bill</a> in <strong>Kentucky</strong> would allow <strong>computer science</strong> courses to count as a <strong>foreign language</strong> requirement.</p>

<p>The <strong>Ohio Department of Education</strong> is proposing to eliminate the &#8220;5 to 8&#8221; rule, <a href="http://www.slj.com/2015/01/legislation/oh-department-of-education-will-vote-to-purge-school-librarian-requirement/">reports the School Library Journal</a>. &#8220;The 30-year-old rule states that at least five of eight of the following full-time education personnel positions must be filled for every 1,000 students in the district: librarian, art teacher, music teacher, physical-education teacher, counselor, nurse, social worker, and visiting teacher.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/01/how-taiwan-is-curbing-childrens-daily-technology-exposure/384830/">A law in <strong>Taiwan</strong></a> now curbs the amount of time that children under age 18 can be exposed to electronic devices. It doesn&#8217;t specify how much time is &#8220;too much,&#8221; but will fine parents whose children become &#8220;physically or mentally&#8221; ill from too much tech exposure.</p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>No Child Left Behind</strong> May End, But The Industry It Spawned Is Here To Stay,&#8221; says <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/no-child-left-behind-gold-rush-continues">Buzzfeed&#8217;s Molly Hensley-Clancy</a>. In other words: NCLB-mandated <strong>standardized testing</strong> is (maybe) dead; long live standardized testing.</p>

<h3>Education and the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p><strong>Steven Salaita</strong> has <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/salaita-goes-after-university-donors-in-lawsuit-over-illinois-job-loss/92975">filed a lawsuit</a> against the <strong>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</strong> &#8211; administrators, trustees, and university donors &#8211; over the school&#8217;s decision to revoke the job offer for tenured professorship because of pro-Palestinian comments he made on social media.</p>

<p>A class action lawsuit in <strong>Alabama</strong> alleges that school police officers used excessive force on students. <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/01/26/in-your-face">From The Marshall Project</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The eight lead plaintiffs, all former Birmingham high school students, are represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Incident reports show that <strong>Birmingham school officers have used a pepper spray/tear gas combination product on over 300 students since 2006</strong>, in 110 separate incidents at eight of the city's nine high schools, according to SPLC attorney Ebony Howard. (The only school where chemical spray was not used requires high test scores for admission.) The lawsuit seeks to curtail the practice and win damages for several of the plaintiffs, all of whom are black &#8211; like 96 percent of Birmingham public school students.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Garfield High School teacher <strong>Jesse Hagopian</strong> &#8211; instrumental in that school&#8217;s &#8220;opt out&#8221; efforts &#8211; is <a href="http://rt.com/usa/227567-seattle-pepper-spray-teacher/">suing the city of Seattle</a> for $500,000 after he was <strong>pepper-sprayed</strong> by police after speaking at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/article_8cff1bc9-9cbf-57d6-ae09-c25a2f82ea3a.html">From the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch</a>, &#8220;A federal judge in <strong>Missouri</strong> has ordered a <strong>charter school</strong> operator to pay nearly $1 million to the board of Renaissance Academy in Kansas City for saddling the school with unreasonably high lease payments.&#8221; (The charter school chain in question: <strong>Imagine Schools Inc</strong>.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/2015/01/28/palantir-co-founder-joe-lonsdale-04-accused-of-sexual-assaulting-then-stanford-student/">According to The Stanford Daily</a>, Joe Lonsdale &#8211; the co-founder of <strong>Palantir</strong> and founder of the VC fund Formation 8 &#8211; has been accused of <strong>sexual assault</strong> while he was a student at <strong>Stanford</strong>. A lawsuit by the alleged victim was filed this week.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice has agreed to pay Nicholas George <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4820d87bdcd246409299dc8b2718b18f/student-stopped-airport-over-arabic-flashcards-wins-25k">$25,000</a> after detaining him at an airport for 5 hours because he had <strong>Arabic language flash cards</strong> in his pocket.</p>

<h3>Davos&#8217; Education &#8220;Fix&#8221;</h3>
<br />
<p>Private equity investor <strong>Stephen Schwarzmann</strong> thinks that public schools should not get more money but can instead be &#8220;fixed&#8221; with <strong>unpaid labor</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wondered, what you do in a society with people who just retire,&#8221; he told conference attendees. &#8220;If you could get those people, like a board, [to be an] unpaid workforce, pay them next to nothing or nothing, and have them go into the school system to be mentors to kids, and be an example of a certain type of success that you would get dramatically different outcomes. If you can get unemployed people that cost nothing, that can have this dramatic difference, that costs nothing. I love things that cost nothing that have great results. Imagine if you laid on technology and other types of things, you could really set the world on fire with this type of stuff.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

Enrollment is openly open to UM students, so it&#8217;s not open. There&#8217;ll only be 800 students, so it&#8217;s not massive. And while there are TV show episodes, it&#8217;s not online.</p>
