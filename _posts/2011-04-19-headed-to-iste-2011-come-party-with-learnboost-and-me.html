<p>Press registration is finally available for <a href="http://www.isteconference.org/2011/">ISTE 2011</a> in Philadelphia.  That means it's time for me to make my plans for getting to what's touted as the largest education technology conference in the world.</p>
<p>This will be my seventh ISTE Conference, but it will actually be the first that I <em>attend</em> and not <em>work</em>.  Well, I mean, I'll be working, of course.  But "journalist" and "conference organizer" are pretty different roles.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about the event (I mean, I quit ISTE to become a freelance writer, after all).  But I can't pass up the opportunity to go talk to educators, to finally meet<a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/">Richard Byrne</a>, to hear <a href="http://practicaltheory.org/serendipity/">Chris Lehmann</a>'s keynote, to see my former co-workers (and hug them and not have to worry about tchotchkes for the Opening Reception) and to see more of <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/01/29/dispatches-from-educon-a-technology-journalist-at-an-education-conference/">Philadelphia</a>.  I did not eat a single Tastykake when I was there for EduCon.</p>
<p>So I'll be at ISTE 2011, and if <em>you'll</em> be at ISTE 2011, then hopefully I'll see you.  One place you can be sure to catch me:  <a href="http://www.learnboost.com">LearnBoost</a>'s big party on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>LearnBoost -- makers of a free online gradebook and open source hackers extraordinaire - are throwing a <a href="http://blog.learnboost.com/iste-learnboost-party/">party</a> on Tuesday, June 28, 4:30 at The Mission Grill.</p>
<p>All LearnBoost users are invited to attend, but  I have 3 tickets to give away to people who don't yet have a LearnBoost account.  If you're interested in attending, comment below or <a href="mailto:audrey.watters@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.</p>
<p>See you in Philly at the end of June, folks!</p>
