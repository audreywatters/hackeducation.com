<p style="text-align: left;"><br />At the flashy Las Vegas gathering this week, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cesweb.org/">Consumer Electronics Show</a>, there will likely be a lot of tablets unveiled, but none are as eagerly anticipated as the OLPC XO 3.0, a tablet version of the famously inexpensive and rugged laptop from&nbsp;<a href="http://laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child</a>&nbsp;founder Nicholas Negroponte.</p>
<p>The tablet release comes after bruising criticism of the highly anticipated laptop several years ago, which some in the industry<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/NussbaumOnDesign/archives/2007/09/its_time_to_cal.html">&nbsp;called a failure</a>. One of the main criticisms was the laptop&rsquo;s lack of mobility: &ldquo;Cell phones are far more popular as the means to connect to the net in much of the Third World and cell-phone type devices rather than cute little laptops might have made much more sense,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/NussbaumOnDesign/archives/2007/09/its_time_to_cal.html">writes BusinessWeek&rsquo;s Bruce Nussbaum</a>.</p>
