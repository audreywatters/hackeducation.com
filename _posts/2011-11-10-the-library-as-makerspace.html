<p><strong>My favorite story of the week:</strong></p>
<p><em><em>...Earlier this year, <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2011/03/is-it-time-to-rebuild-retool-public-libraries-and-make-techshops.html">MAKE Magazine's Phillip Torrone</a> wrote a provocative article asking Is it time to rebuild and retool libraries and make �techshops'? In other words, should libraries join some of the other new community centers that are being created (such as <a href="http://generalassemb.ly">General Assembly</a> which we <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/11/new-york-citys-general-assembly-the-university-of-the-future/">covered</a>yesterday) and become hackerspaces or makerspaces?</em></em></p>
<p><em>Yes!, says librarian Lauren Smedley, who is in the process of creating what might just be the first maker-space within a U.S. public library. The <a href="http://www.fayettevillefreelibrary.org/">Fayetteville Free Library</a> where Smedley works is building a <a href="http://www.fayettevillefreelibrary.org/about-us/services/fablab.html">Fab Lab</a> � short for fabrication laboratory � that will provide free public access to machines and software for manufacturing and making things.</em></p>
