<h2>Labor / Unions</h2>
<p>A district office of the <strong>National Labor Relations Board</strong> has <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/03/27/nlrb-office-backs-union-northwestern-football-players">ruled</a> in favor of student athletes at <strong>Northwestern University</strong> in their bid to form a union. While the university will appeal, this is still a huge decision that could have <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-northwestern-union-bid-20140326,0,6454823.story">sweeping implications</a> for college sports and the people and institutions who profit off the free labor of these young adults.</p>
<p>Members of England&rsquo;s <strong>National Union of Teachers</strong> went <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/education-26729786">on strike</a> this week to protest the government&rsquo;s &ldquo;accountability regime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DC-based <strong>adjunct instructors</strong> are <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/Unionized-Adjuncts-in/145541/">seeking</a> to craft a common labor agreement that would cover all unionized adjuncts in the city.</p>
<p>Students at the <strong>University of Southern Maine</strong> occupied the hall outside the provost&rsquo;s office, protesting faculty layoffs at the school. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/03/24/fight-over-layoffs-university-southern-maine-boils-over">More via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Vergara v California</em></strong> trial <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/vergara-trial-ends-with-ca-teacher-laws-hanging-in-the-balance/">wrapped up</a> this week. Plaintiffs seek to end teacher seniority and tenure rules in the state.</p>
<p>A select group of teachers in <strong>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools</strong> will be <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/03/25/4793896/cms-reveals-system-for-500-raises.html">eligible</a> for $500 a year raises and four-year contracts, in exchange for giving up their <strong>tenure</strong>. Um. Sounds like a great deal.</p>
<h2>Chicago Education Politics Are So Special They Get Their Own Subsection This Week</h2>
<p>After closing a record number of schools and after district-wide budget cuts last year, &ldquo;<strong>Chicago Public Schools</strong> is <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/26433549-418/chicago-public-schools-wants-to-spend-nearly-10-million-on-furniture-other-costs.html">seeking</a> to double its furniture budget to $9.5 million, chalking up $5 million of that to an upcoming move of its central headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>Chicago Board of Education</strong> has privatized its custodial services. Now it&rsquo;s looking to hire outside companies to <a href="http://www.substancenews.net/articles.php?page=4896&amp;section=Article">run school recess</a>.</p>
<p>Publishing exec Steve Forbes has told Chicago Mayor <strong>Rahm Emmanuel</strong> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2014/03/28/steve-forbes-to-rahm-emanuel-you-might-make-a-good-president/">he&rsquo;d make a good president</a>. Well, Rahm has certainly furthered shitty education policies just like the last few administrations &ndash; he&rsquo;s got that going for him, at least.</p>
<h2>The Politics of Education Standards</h2>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong> has become the first state to <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/03/24/293894857/indiana-becomes-first-state-to-back-out-of-common-core">ditch</a> the <strong>Common Core</strong>.</p>

<p>Behaviorist app <strong>ClassDojo</strong> has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-03-27-classdojo-announces-new-messaging-feature">launched</a> a new feature: messaging. This will allow teachers using the app to message (reward) individual parents and/or whole classes.</p>
<p><strong>Khan Academy</strong> has launched Common Core-aligned &ldquo;math missions&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s code for math exercises, but <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-03-25-math-of-khan-sal-explains-academy-s-common-core-aligned-missions">golly doesn&rsquo;t it sound exciting</a>?!)</p>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong> has <a href="http://revolucaoebook.com.br/amazon-oferece-servico-graca-escolhida-pelo-mec-para-distribuir-200-ebooks/">struck a deal</a> with the Brazilian government to deliver 200 textbook titles to teachers and students in the country.</p>

<h2>Data and Privacy</h2>
<p>Just four weeks after a massive data breach, the <strong>University of Maryland</strong> <a href="http://www.ecampusnews.com/safety-and-security/maryland-data-second-025/">says</a> it&rsquo;s experienced another &ldquo;cyber intrusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A student from Minnewaska School District in <strong>Minnesota</strong> has <a href="http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/tv/252269261.html">settled</a> a lawsuit with her school over claims that officials has violated her constitutional rights by viewing her Facebook and email without her permission.</p>
<p>The <strong>FTC</strong> and the <strong>California</strong> attorney general have <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/u-s-and-california-officials-enter-battle-over-facebook-privacy-settlement/">filed briefs</a> in an appeals court case over <strong>Facebook</strong>&rsquo;s use of teens&rsquo; data in advertising, arguing the judge who approved a settlement in the case had done so in error.</p>
<h2>MOOCs</h2>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve reached <strong><a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/education/mooc-20-open-online-education-moves-forward">MOOC 2.0</a></strong> apparently.</p>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/80601201906/welcome-rick-levin-as-ceo-of-coursera">announced</a> this week that it&rsquo;s hired former <strong>Yale University</strong> president <strong>Rick Levin</strong> as its new CEO. (Last year, the company appointed one of its VCs, Lila Ibrahim, as President. She&rsquo;ll now be the Chief Business Officer.) Coursera hailed Levin&rsquo;s &ldquo;visionary foray into online education, first in partnership with Stanford and Oxford, and later with <strong>Open Yale Courses</strong>,&rdquo; but didn&rsquo;t really go into detail about how that former effort &ndash; <strong>AllLearn</strong> &ndash; was a huge failure. But hey. We don&rsquo;t talk about ed-tech history. It&rsquo;s all disruption and unicorns these days.</p>
<p><strong>edX</strong> has hired <strong>Wendy Cebula</strong> as its new president and COO. Cebula is a former Vistaprint exec. Looking at both the Coursera and edX appointments, Phil Hill asks &ldquo;<a href="http://mfeldstein.com/coursera-edx-hires-new-execs/">what about online experience?</a>&rdquo; I would add &ldquo;what about a business model?&rdquo; But then again, unicorns.</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Chicago</strong> has <a href="http://mitopencourseware.wordpress.com/2014/03/24/university-of-chicago-joins-edx-edx-blog/">joined</a> <strong>edX</strong>.</p>

<p>Also certain to keep MOOCs relevant: Coursera&rsquo;s courses are now <a href="http://tech.coursera.org/blog/2014/03/25/lti-1-1-enabled-in-all-courses/"><strong>LTI 1.1</strong> enabled</a>. (That is, the Learning Tools Interoperability Standard used by LMSes.)</p>
<p>The <strong>European Commission</strong> is <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-335_en.htm">launching</a> &ldquo;a network of providers of MOOCs related to web and apps skills.&rdquo; Google posted to its research blog a post titled &ldquo;<a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.nl/2014/03/making-sense-of-mooc-data.html">Making Sense of MOOC Data</a>,&rdquo; drawing on the data from the MOOCs that the company has run in order to give us remarkable insights like &ldquo;our research indicates that learners who complete activities are more likely to complete the course than peers who completed no activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>University of California</strong> President <strong>Janet Napolitano</strong> is skeptical of online courses, particularly for remediation. Speaking at a luncheon in Sacramento, she <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/25/us-usa-california-napolitano-idUSBREA2O02R20140325">said</a> that online education is &ldquo;harder than it looks and if you do it right, it doesn&rsquo;t save all that much money.&rdquo;</p>

The move has many in the company and Mozilla community upset, as it calls into question Mozilla&rsquo;s values of openness. (Eich was a financial supporter of Prop 8, an anti- gay marriage initiative in California.)</p>

Among the potential uses for VR, says Mark Zuckerberg, &ldquo;studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world &hellip; &ndash; just by putting on goggles in your home.&rdquo; Add this to the company&rsquo;s recent partnership with <strong>edX</strong> and you have virtual worlds plus MOOCs &ndash; pretty much the Horizon Report ed-tech fantasy. Whee.</p>
<p><strong>Clever</strong>, which helps schools integrate software and student information systems, has <a href="http://recode.net/2014/03/25/clever-maker-of-an-api-for-schools-raises-10-3m/">raised</a> $10.3 million from Sequoia Capital, Y Combinator&rsquo;s Paul Graham, and GSV&rsquo;s Deborah Quazzo.

<h2>Great Moments in Education Anti-Science</h2>
<p>In an examination of <strong>school vouchers</strong>, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/education-creationism-104934.html">Politico reports that</a> &ldquo;Taxpayers in 14 states will bankroll nearly $1 billion this year in tuition for private schools, including hundreds of religious schools that teach Earth is less than 10,000 years old, Adam and Eve strolled the garden with dinosaurs, and much of modern biology, geology and cosmology is a web of lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Knewton</strong> wants to &ldquo;<a href="http://www.knewton.com/blog/ceo-jose-ferreira/rebooting-learning-styles/">reboot learning styles</a>,&rdquo; which are so key to their grandiose marketing claims. Questioning the research of psychology professors like Daniel Willingham that has found no evidence of learning styles, CEO Jose Ferreira says that &ldquo;To me, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that different learning styles exist.&rdquo; So it&rsquo;s settled then.</p>
<p>Among the trends I&rsquo;m seeing in ed-tech these days: lots of pseudoscience bullshittery, particularly when it comes to claims about cognitive and neuroscience. <a href="http://qz.com/191925/the-scant-science-behind-anything-that-claims-to-boost-your-brainpower/">Quartz takes a look</a> this week at &ldquo;the scant science behind anything that claims to boost your brainpower.&rdquo; But companies like <strong>Luminosity</strong> and <strong>Knewton</strong> have raised hundreds of millions of dollars.
