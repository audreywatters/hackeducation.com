<p>"I'm a fan of hard science fiction, which is science fiction that is possible. The science fiction books I like tend to relate to what we're doing at Khan Academy, like Orson Scott Card's 'Ender's Game' series and Isaac Asimov's 'Foundation' series." -" <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/opinion/sunday/catching-up-with-sal-khan.html">Salman Khan</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arguably the first work of science fiction, <em>Frankenstein</em> is a story about technology and education (and <a href="http://monsters.hackeducation.com">monsters</a>). As a fan of the genre, I&#8217;m probably just as interested in the depiction of education in science fiction as I am in the historical and present-day narratives about education technology. I&#8217;m particularly interested in how these are intertwined &#8211; Salman Khan&#8217;s invocation of <em>Ender&#8217;s Game</em>, for example.</p>

<p>I asked for recommendations on ed-tech SF on Twitter the other day (I <a href="https://storify.com/audreywatters/education-technology-in-science-fiction">storified</a> the responses).</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;ve started a <a href="http://sf.hackeducation.com">bibliography</a>, building a list of novels, short stories, and movies that explore education&#8217;s future. (Not all of these fit neatly into the SF genre.)</p>

<p>Like all my projects, this is <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/ed-tech-sf">hosted on GitHub</a>. That means you can submit a <a href="http://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/">pull request</a> in order to suggest I add something to the list.</p>
