<p>Teachers, Tech Coordinators, Administrators, Geeky Educators of all sorts:</p>
<p>I am working on some ideas for a back-to-school series of posts.</p>
<p>Please <a href="mailto:audrey@readwriteweb.com">send me an email</a> with your thoughts on the one tech tool you're most excited to bring into the classroom with you  -- can be hardware or software, can be something you or your students will use, can be a new tool or an "old" one.</p>
