<p>The <strong>Boy Scouts of America</strong> unveiled a new merit badge this week, for work in <a href="http://boyslife.org/section/about-scouts/merit-badge-resources/robotics/">Robotics</a>.  Among the badge's requirements, Boy Scouts will have to design, build and test a robot with at least two degrees of freedom and at least one sensor.</p>
<p>The winners of <a href="http://www.imaginecup.com/"><strong>Microsoft's Imagine Cup</strong></a> were selected this week.

The winners in the Software Design were the team from Arizona State University who developed a note-taking app for low-vision and legally blind individuals.</p>
<p>RIP <strong>Flip camera</strong>.  Cisco announced this week that it was shutting down production of the popular device.  Although Flip cameras have been popular in the classroom, many industry observers say Cisco's decision reflects the fact that people aren't interested in single-use devices, particularly now that cellphones have good video capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42560609/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/">News broke</a> this week that a school district in Auburn, Maine plans to equip all its kindergarteners with <strong>iPads</strong> next year, at a cost of around $200,000.  Some have expressed concern that 5 year-olds are "too young" for the technology, but others insist that the devices are ideal for that age level.  The state of Maine has long been on the leading edge of one-to-one laptop initiatives.</p>

<p>The education company <strong>Pearson</strong> released the results of a <a href="http://www.pearsoncustom.com/educators/Social_Media_Report.pdf">survey</a> this week, detailing the usage of social media by college professors.  Pearson found that more than 90% of college faculty use social media in the workplace -- that's almost twice the rate of employees in other industries. More than 40% of respondents say they require their students to use of faculty say they require students to use social media as part of course assignments.  Despite being avid users, faculty responding to the survey did indicate that they have some concerns about social media and privacy.</p>
