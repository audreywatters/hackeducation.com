<p><a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20110407/intel-capital-conde-nast-ownerinvest-30-million-in-student-tablet-start-up-kno-intel-takes-over-hardware-biz/">It's official</a>:  the educational tablet maker <a href="http://www.kno.com">Kno</a> is officially abandoning hardware manufacturing, licensing the design to <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a>, and switching its focus to its "robust software and services."</p>
<p>If the story sounds familiar, indeed, it's confirmation of what <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20110221/exclusive-kno-student-tablet-start-up-in-talks-to-sell-off-tablet-part-of-business/">All Things D's Kara Swisher</a> reported in February.  No more Kno tablet.</p>
<p>I wrote a good piece back then -- "<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/02/22/no-kno-not-now-not-ever/">No Kno (Not Now, Not Ever)</a>" -- in which I looked at the challenges of building hardware aimed solely at the student (tablet) market.  Back then I questioned whether, in fact, software would really be the easier path for the company to take.  Today's news that Kno has taken on an additional $30 million in investment (from Intel Capital and Condï¿½ Nast) will, I suppose, make that path somewhat easier.   But I still have little confidence.  Kno confidence.  Whatever.</p>
<p>So instead of just regurgitating what's really been my refrain since I first caught wind of the dedicated student tablet, I'm going to run through a list of alternative Kno headlines.  I'm looking for your suggestions too, because I'm running out of witty things to say about student tablets:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Oh Kno!</li>
<li>Hell Kno!</li>
<li>No Kno</li>
<li>No One Kno's</li>
<li>(K)No More Tablet</li>
<li>What Do You Kno?</li>
<li>Kno Way!</li>
<li>Knoing is Overrated</li>
<li>Kno Knows Bounds</li>
<li>Hey Kno, You Forgot the W</li>
<li>Now You Kno:  Was Kno-ing Half the Battle?</li>
<li>There's No Business like Kno Business</li>
<li>We Don't Need Kno Stinking Tablets</li>
</ul>
<p><em>With thanks to those who offered their suggestions via Twitter</em></p>
