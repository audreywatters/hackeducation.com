<p>In addition to starting wikis for <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/hackeducation.com/edtech-blogs/">EdTech blogs</a> and <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/hackeducation.com/edtech-startups/">EdTech startups</a>, I am starting a calendar for EdTech events.  As with the other two, this is partly for my own research.  And as with the other two, it's a project that's much closer to "idea" than to "implementation."</p>
<p>The only event I've added to the calendar is <a href="http://center.uoregon.edu/ISTE/2010/">ISTE 2010</a>, which describes itself as the largest edtech conference and exhibition in the world.  It's also the event that I've spent a good chunk of my adult life involved with -- for four years or so as the registration coordinator and for not-quite-two as ISTE's SIG Program Manager.</p>
<p>Although I was relieved at first to not be headed to Denver this year (anyone in the event industry knows that conferences are <em>insane</em>), now that the event is just around the corner, I confess I'm a little sad to not be there.  The conference is a pretty spectacular thing, and it's amazing to see all the educators there who are interested in teaching/learning and tech.  I have a lot of questions for a lot of folks -- much better questions that ones about menu or room layout or workshop registration or presenter reimbursement.  Oh and I'm pretty sure I'm missing out on the best.time.ever with <a href="http://sigilt.iste.wikispaces.net/">SIGILT</a> and Casa Bonita.</p>
<p>As I won't be in Denver and as I need to expand my horizons, I need to research some other EdTech events to attend.  Any suggestions?</p>
