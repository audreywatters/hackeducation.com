<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 1 of my <a href="http://hackeducation.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=2014trends">Top 10 Ed-Tech Trends of 2014</a> series</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time once again for my annual review of the dominant trends in education technology. This is the fifth year that I&rsquo;ve done this. It&rsquo;s a massive undertaking, aided in part by the weekly roundups of all the education-related news that I write every week. It&rsquo;s a project that I both dread &ndash; I mean, this is how I will spend December &ndash; and adore. I learn so much about the politics, industry, implementation, ideology, business, and bullshit by scrutinizing the year's occurences so closely. As someone who is fascinated by the cultural history of ed-tech, it&rsquo;s always useful for me to see what stories are told most frequently and most passionately, what stories resonate and why.</p>
<p>A quick look back at previous year&rsquo;s trends:</p>

<p>As you can see by this list, some things change; some things don&rsquo;t. Indeed, last year I kicked off the series by arguing that what we often see in education technology are &ldquo;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/11/18/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2013-zombie-ideas/">zombie ideas</a>,&rdquo; monstrosities that just don&rsquo;t seem to die.</p>
<p>Almost all of the trends I&rsquo;ve identified in previous years continue to play some sort of role in the education landscape today. We haven&rsquo;t resolved issues around data and privacy or around the high cost of higher education, for example. We&rsquo;re still seeing schools struggle with social media and with 1:1 computing initiatives.</p>
<p><em>One programming note: Because the posts in this series tend to be so long, they actually break the technology of &ldquo;the blog.&rdquo; That is, I run up against the word count limit in my CMS. And I run up against the file size limit of feeds in Feedburner. For that reason, I&rsquo;m going to post these stories into a GitHub repository and you'll be able to access them via GitHub pages at <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com">2014trends.hackeducation.com</a>. Feel free to leave comments there about typos. Or ya know, do a pull request. I&rsquo;ll post a portion of each post here still &ndash; the old truncated blog post thing &ndash; and you&rsquo;ll have to click over to read the rest of the story over there. Sorry. That sucks, I know. Let it be a nice little reminder about how much technology sucks, and how we still can&rsquo;t get the simplest things right.</em></p>
<h2>All the Buzz about Digital Disruption</h2>
<p>Education technology has become a bit of a buzzword in its own right. Or at least, if you put the adjective &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/education/new-all-digital-curriculums-hope-to-ride-high-tech-push-in-schoolrooms.html">digital</a>&rdquo; in front of an educational practice or a piece of educational content, then you can act as though you&rsquo;re tapping into something profoundly new and transformative and, as the Obama Administration now calls it, &ldquo;<a href="http://tech.ed.gov/futurereadypledge/">future ready</a>.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a boon for the education industry, no doubt, which has seen record levels investment into ed-tech startups this year (more on that in the next post in this series), despite reports of <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/06/purchases_of_classroom_materials_falls_in_early_2014_in_reversal_from_2013.html">slower sales</a> of digital (and print) materials. <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2014/08/04/as-book-prices-drop-big-publishers-push-into-software-and-edtech/">So much for predictions that</a> ed-tech would handily &ldquo;disrupt&rdquo; the textbook publishers or other existing education companies. (Take <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/27/5850590/the-trapper-keeper-is-now-a-tablet-case">the Trapper Keeper</a>, for example. It now holds a tablet instead of spiral notebooks. And it costs a lot more too.)</p>
<p>Ah, &ldquo;<strong><a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/181762/venture-capitalists-are-poised-disrupt-everything-about-education-market">disruption</a></strong>.&rdquo; It remains one of the buzziest buzzwords in education technology, alongside its partner word &ldquo;<strong>innovation</strong>.&rdquo; Silicon Valley likes to think of itself as having <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/AltSchool-gets-33-million-in-venture-capital-5327204.php">cornered the market</a> (get it?) on innovation. That&rsquo;s a core part of its ideology: innovation happens <em>with</em> tech and <em>by</em> tech and thanks <em>to</em> the technology industry &ndash; not thanks to the public sector. (<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/05/14/innovation-cnie-2014/">My keynote</a> this spring at the Canadian Network for Innovation in Education addressed this.) In February, for example, the Silicon Valley Education Foundation and NewSchools Venture Fund <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-02-04-silicon-valley-launches-new-innovation-zone">unveiled</a> a Learning Innovation Hub to bring about innovation &ndash; or at least to help train educators on using ed-tech products. <a href="http://www.edukwest.com/hedline-icf-selects-learn-capital-fund-manager-20-million-education-innovation-fund/">In April</a>, the International Finance Corporation, the investment wing of the World Bank, set aside $20 million for investment in &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; through ed-tech VC firm Learn Capital.</p>
<p>In July, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), known best in some education circles perhaps for its PISA tests, issued a report on &ldquo;<a href="http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/measuring-innovation-in-education.htm#ES">Measuring Innovation in Education</a>.&rdquo; In it, the OECD asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do teachers innovate? Do they try different pedagogical approaches? Are practices within classrooms and educational organisations changing? And to what extent can change be linked to improvements? <strong>A measurement agenda is essential to an innovation and improvement strategy in education</strong>. Measuring Innovation in Education offers new perspectives on addressing the need for such measurement. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how countries rank &mdash; ah, the element of international competition &mdash; in terms of &ldquo;innovation&rdquo;:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/innovation.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The US&rsquo;s ranking prompted hand-wringing headlines like &ldquo;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/report-finds-u-s-schools-rank-below-average-in-innovation-1405635683">Report Finds U.S. Schools Rank Below Average in Innovation</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-07-22-not-just-the-pisa-oecd-says-u-s-schools-also-behind-on-innovation">Not Just the PISA: OECD Says U.S. Schools Also Behind on &lsquo;Innovation&rsquo;</a>&rdquo; &mdash; neatly confirming an education reform narrative that schools simply aren't &ldquo;good enough,&rdquo; and in this case, aren&rsquo;t as &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; as the business sector. Moreover, schools need to become more like businesses in order to be more "innovative."</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth asking <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/07/21/this-is-educational-innovation/">how the heck you measure &ldquo;innovation,&rdquo;</a> of course. Not surprisingly, the OECD measures it by looking at educational practices and policies <em>that boost test scores</em>.</p>
<p>Oh. Well then.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen remains the biggest evangelist for &ldquo;innovation,&rdquo; or at least for his particular <em>brand</em> of innovation, &ldquo;<strong>disruptive innovation</strong>.&rdquo; He was <a href="http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/09/educause-2014-online-learning-could-fundamentally-change-role-universities">a keynote</a> this year at EDUCAUSE, higher education&rsquo;s major ed-tech industry gala. While many other pundits have softened their predictions about the revolutionary potential for MOOCs, Christensen insists that &ldquo;<a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/05/09/moocs-disruption-only-beginning/S2VlsXpK6rzRx4DMrS4ADM/story.html">MOOCs&rsquo; disruption is only beginning</a>.&rdquo; And he&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/clay-christensen-on-disruption-theory-apple-2014-11">doubled-down</a> on his prophecy that, thanks to disruptive innovation, &ldquo;half of universities will go bankrupt in the next 15 years.&rdquo; (Mike Caulfield has graciously made us <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/clay-christensen-on-disruption-theory-apple-2014-11">a countdown clock</a> so we can keep track of the impending higher ed apocalypse.)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been <a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/2014/11/24/clayton-christensen-becomes-his-own-devils-advocate/">some pushback</a> &ndash; and not just from me &ndash; on Christensen's whole &ldquo;disruption machine.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the headline from <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/the-disruption-machine">The New Yorker article</a> published in June in which NYU professor Jill Lepore absolutely excoriates the concept and the whole narrative that&rsquo;s been built up around it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most big ideas have loud critics. Not disruption. Disruptive innovation as the explanation for how change happens has been subject to little serious criticism, partly because it&rsquo;s headlong, while critical inquiry is unhurried; partly because disrupters ridicule doubters by charging them with fogyism, as if to criticize a theory of change were identical to decrying change; and partly because, in its modern usage, innovation is the idea of progress jammed into a criticism-proof jack-in-the-box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christensen responded to Lepore&rsquo;s article angrily, and <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-20/clayton-christensen-responds-to-new-yorker-takedown-of-disruptive-innovation">in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek</a>, repeatedly called her &ldquo;Jill&rdquo; (not, say, "Dr. Lepore") even though he admitted they&rsquo;d never met. There were <a href="https://twitter.com/asimone/status/479027934112407552/photo/1">similarly sexist responses</a> from other powerful tech-bros. Tech bros &ndash; oh boy, was that ever a big trend this year. That's gonna be a great post in this series, just you wait.</p>
<h2>Blended and Personalized: Words Drained of Meaning</h2>
<p>As the frequent invocation of &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and &ldquo;disruption&rdquo; highlights, there comes a point when words that might have had a specific meaning &ndash; &ldquo;disruptive innovation&rdquo; for example &ndash; get drained of all of that. Applied to every new product, every new policy, every new investment, the words lose their substance but, ironically perhaps, gain in significance. That&rsquo;s how buzzwords work. They&rsquo;re used to sound new and edgy and fashionable and perhaps fancy and jargonistic, but they lack a certain depth, I think, and a certain specificity. I read these words in press releases and in headlines and wonder, &ldquo;What the hell are you even talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the best examples of this: &ldquo;<strong>Blended Learning</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>Personalized Learning</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes <a href="http://edglossary.org/blended-learning/">blended learning</a> means a mixture of human- and computer-based instruction. Sometimes it means that computer-based instruction is online. Sometimes the emphasis is on the different education technologies themselves &ndash; audio, video, adaptive quizzes, and the like. Sometimes blended learning is called hybrid learning. Sometimes it&rsquo;s positioned as being a lynchpin to liberate the school system from &ldquo;seat time.&rdquo; Sometimes it&rsquo;s positioned as something that gives the student more control. Or at least they can "move at their own pace." (And here, I mutter something about Papert and his reminder that we need to distinguish between the child programming the computer and the computer programming the child. Read <em>Mindstorms</em>, dammit.) Often blended learning is wrapped up with other rhetoric about technology&rsquo;s connection to education reform. Sometimes blended learning is labeled as &ldquo;disruptive.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the argument that Michael Horn of the Clayton Christensen Institute makes in his 2014 book <em>Blended: Using Disruptive Innovation to Improve Schools</em>. (Horn was co-author with Christensen on <em>Disrupting Class</em>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/ssf-cci">The Christensen Institute has partnered with Silicon Schools Fund and with Khan Academy</a> &ldquo;to provide insight and guidance on delivering high-quality blended learning.&rdquo; I still don&rsquo;t quite know what &ldquo;blended learning&rdquo; means (or why it&rsquo;s a good idea), but hey, they insist it&rsquo;ll &ldquo;personalize learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Personalized learning. I always want to respond to this in my best Inigo Montoya voice, &ldquo;You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one hand, &ldquo;personalized learning&rdquo; sounds pretty good: a nod towards more student-centered learning perhaps, a move that honors the <em>person</em> learning not just the learning <em>institution</em>. But on the other hand, I do not think it means what you think it means. Often, what I see the term applied to gives me pause &ndash; &ldquo;personalized learning&rdquo; appears to be more focused on the scripting than on the student. Personalized learning isn&rsquo;t personal learning. And often, it&rsquo;s really &ldquo;personalized instruction&rdquo; &ndash; not focused on the person or the learning but on individualized delivery of standardized content and assessment. For some ed-tech industry folks, it's indistinguishable from &ldquo;<a href="http://dangerouslyirrelevant.org/2014/02/personalized-learning-v-targeted-advertising.html">targeted advertising</a>&rdquo; even. So that's something to look forward to.</p>
<p>UCLA professor Noel Enyedy recently released a <a href="http://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/personalized-instruction">report</a> on &ldquo;personalized instruction&rdquo; and the subtitle speaks volumes here: &ldquo;New Interest, Old Rhetoric, Limited Results, and the Need for a New Direction for Computer-Mediated Learning.&rdquo; What we&rsquo;ve done is repackage an old model of what computers could do in education &ndash; again as Papert would put it, &ldquo; to program the child&rdquo; &ndash; and simply label it something buzzy. There isn&rsquo;t really research to show &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; will transform education. There isn&rsquo;t really much proof it&rsquo;s going to save school districts money (<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/06/study_reveals_personalized_lea.html">to the contrary</a>). But it&rsquo;s one helluva powerful buzzword.</p>

Then there's <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141015-angela-duckworth-success-grit-psychology-self-control-science-nginnovators/">grit</a>. &ldquo;<a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Growth mindset</a>.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.knewton.com/blog/ceo-jose-ferreira/rebooting-learning-styles/">Learning styles</a>. Yes. Learning styles. Still.</p>
<h2>Buzzwords and Believability</h2>
<p>In a blog post this year, Knewton CEO Jose Ferreira <a href="http://www.knewton.com/blog/ceo-jose-ferreira/rebooting-learning-styles/">insisted</a> that learning styles exist because &ldquo;to me, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious.&rdquo; This is a perfect example of how buzzwords dovetail so neatly with believability. Even though there is <a href="http://www.danielwillingham.com/learning-styles-faq.html">no evidence</a> that learning styles are real, the phrase is repeated so often, some people are certain that they must.</p>
<p>So much of education technology works this way. Blended learning, personalized learning, learning styles &ndash; they must be good because, after all, &ldquo;to me, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-04-30-twitter-exec-reports-that-educators-dominate-the-twitter-sphere"> A company releases a number</a>, wraps it in a PR message, and as long as it fits the story we want to tell, it becomes the truth, widely repeated but never widely challenged.</p>
<p>One final ed-tech buzzword to demonstrate this: &ldquo;<strong>brain training</strong>.&rdquo; Plenty of startups raised venture capital this year <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/01/halo-the-brain-improving-wearable-raises-1-5-million/">promising</a> to do just that, even though <a href="http://qz.com/191925/the-scant-science-behind-anything-that-claims-to-boost-your-brainpower/">the scientific community</a> &ndash; perhaps most loudly, the Stanford Center on Longevity and the Berlin Max Planck Institute for Human Development &ndash; have repeated that there&rsquo;s <a href="http://longevity3.stanford.edu/blog/2014/10/15/the-consensus-on-the-brain-training-industry-from-the-scientific-community-2/">very little supporting evidence</a> that playing brain games and the like improves one&rsquo;s cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>But we like the buzzwordiness of &ldquo;brain training,&rdquo; I guess. We find comfort in stories that our brains are fixable and flexible and that <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/spritz-speed-reading-galaxy-s5/31063/">with the right technology</a> we fill them more rapidly with words and concepts and learning and stuff. We find comfort in these stories even if they <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/is-speed-reading-possible/284326/">aren&rsquo;t true</a>. They feel good. They feel right. "To me, it's pretty obvious."</p>
<p>I mean, why stop and consider the science of learning or the history of ed-tech or its ideologies or its mythologies when we can rely on buzzwords instead? After all, buzzwords make the business of ed-tech so much better.</p>
