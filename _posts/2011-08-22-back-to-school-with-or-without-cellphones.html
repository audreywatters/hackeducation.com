<p>Last week, a <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Cell-Phones.aspx">study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project</a> found that cellphones have become near ubiquitous: 83% of American adults own one. Over half of all adult mobile phone owners had used their phones at least once to get information they needed right away. And more than a quarter said that they had experienced a situation in the previous month in which they had trouble doing something because they did not have their phones at hand.</p>
<p>The findings of this Pew research � the reliance of adults on their cellphones � stands in sharp contrast to the policies of many schools, where cellphones remained banned or restricted. Students likely have these same needs as adults: to get online and find information they need right away. But often students are banned from using their cell phones in schools, something that students themselves list as one of the <a href="http://www.tomorrow.org/speakup/speakup_reports.html">greatest obstacles they face</a> in using technology in the classroom.</p>
