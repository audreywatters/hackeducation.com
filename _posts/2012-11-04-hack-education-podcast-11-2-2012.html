<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week. Unfortunately it seems like lately our conversations aren't just thought-provoking but they're plagued with technical difficulties. Grr.</p>
<p>This week, we discuss ed-tech bubbles, Sal Khan's history of education, Instructure's new MOOC network, and George Lucas's plans to donate his $4 billion windfall from the sale of Lucasfilm to education (but probably not to Steve or me).</p>
