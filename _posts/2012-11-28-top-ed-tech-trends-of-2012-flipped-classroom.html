<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 4 of my <a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=ed-tech%20trends%202012">Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2012</a> series</em></p>
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/khanacademy150.jpg" alt="" align="right" />&ldquo;Flipping the classroom&rdquo; is hardly new. But with all the hype surrounding both <a href="http://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> and <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=mooc">MOOCs</a>, it&rsquo;s hardly surprising that the practice became incredibly popular this year.</p>
<p>Indeed, in his <a href="http://youtu.be/gM95HHI4gLk">2011 TED Talk</a> (which has been watched over 2 million times on YouTube), Salman Khan talked about the ways in which his videos are used by teachers to &ldquo;flip the classroom.&rdquo; That is, in lieu of teachers lecturing in the classroom, the Khan Academy video lectures are assigned as homework; then students work on exercises in class where the teacher can more easily assist and remediate. &ldquo;Flipping the classroom&rdquo; has become a crucial part of the story that Khan repeats in his frequent talks and media appearances.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also become part of the argument that <a href="http://coursera.com">Coursera</a> co-founder Daphne Koller makes about how massive open online classes or MOOCs (which, duh, is another huge ed-tech trend of 2012) will change the offline university experience. When Coursera launched in April, <a href="/2012/04/18/coursera/">she told me</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a growing amount of content out there on the Web,&rdquo; says Koller, &ldquo;and so the value proposition for the university is no longer simply getting their content out there. Rather, it&rsquo;s fostering that personal interaction between faculty and students and students and students.&rdquo; By being able to take advantage of online educational content &ndash; particularly lecture content from some of the best professors at the most pretigious universities in the world &ndash; students will benefit too. It&rsquo;ll mean that the university classroom can be &ldquo;flipped&rdquo; &ndash; with lectures pre-recorded and assigned as homework. Koller, who&rsquo;s been flipping her classroom since well before Khan Academy popularized the term, says that universities have been reluctant to add &ldquo;active learning&rdquo; opportunities at expense of covering &ldquo;the curriculum&rdquo; via lecture. And thanks to the increasing wealth of online classes, there&rsquo;ll be more opportunities for hands-on on-campus experiences.</p>
<p>And in turn, by making that content available &ndash; freely and openly on the Web &ndash; that will mean a &ldquo;better education for everyone,&rdquo; say Ng and Keller.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Tools of &ldquo;The Flip&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Coursera and Khan Academy are certainly not the only ed-tech companies that are providing educational video content or the tools to create that content in the service of flipping the classroom.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/teded150.jpg" alt="" align="left" />There&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.showme.com/">ShowMe</a>, for example, which allows anyone &mdash; teachers and students &mdash; to create and share lessons via its whiteboard-like iPad app. (The company updated its app this spring, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/08/showme-version-two/">at the time</a> said that some 1.5 million lessons had been created with the tool.) And there&rsquo;s <a href="http://educreations.com">Educreations</a>, which offers a similar tool and raised $2.2 million in investment this summer. There&rsquo;s the Web-based tool <a href="http://www.sophia.org/">Sophia</a>, which was <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/capella-acquires-sophia-learning-194025266.html">acquired</a> by Capella Education (parent company of the for-profit Capella University) in April. In August, former Flip (the video camera) execs launched <a href="http://knowmia.com/">Knowmia</a>, a platform for &ldquo;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/08/14/former-flip-video-execs-launch-educational-video-platform/">crowdsourced video lessons</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to bring the buzz about the flipped classroom full circle &mdash; back to the medium through which Sal Khan helped popularize it &mdash; TED decided that this was an &ldquo;idea worth spreading&rdquo; and officially <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ted-ed-launches-groundbreaking-website-with-new-tools-for-customized-learning-148820655.html">launched</a> its own education initiative in April. TED-Ed, according to its press release, seeks to &ldquo;inspire curiosity by harnessing the talent of the world&rsquo;s best teachers and visualizers &mdash; and by providing educators with new tools that spark and facilitate learning.&rdquo; With &ldquo;lessons worth sharing,&rdquo; the <a href="http://ed.ted.com/">TED-Ed</a> platform allows teachers to submit their lessons and lectures which are animated by TED and released with additional exercise questions. (The latter are remixable; the lectures and animations are not.)</p>
<h2>The History and the Benefits of &ldquo;The Flip&rdquo;</h2>
<p>As I noted above, the idea of the &ldquo;flipped classroom&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t new to 2012. Nor was it something devised by Khan Academy or TED. Video-taped lectures assigned as homework can be traced back to Colorado math teacher <a href="http://thefischbowl.blogspot.com/2010/09/welcome-sunday-telegraph-and-daniel.html">Karl Fisch</a> who had his work popularized in turn by a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/7996379/Daniel-Pinks-Think-Tank-Flip-thinking-the-new-buzz-word-sweeping-the-US.html">story in 2010 by Daniel Pink</a> who called the practice &ldquo;flip thinking&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Fisch flip.&rdquo; But well before that, many other educators were thinking about ways they could &ldquo;flip&rdquo; or <a href="http://electriceducator.blogspot.com/2010/09/flip-your-classroom-through-reverse.html">reverse instruction</a>: chemistry teachers Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams recorded their lessons circa 2007. And in the 1990s, let&rsquo;s not forget, Harvard professor Eric Mazur pioneered the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_Instruction">peer instruction</a> in order to alter his own teaching practices away from heavy reliance on lecturing.</p>
<p>(As a humanities and literature person here, I can&rsquo;t help but remark that the teaching practices in my field have always involved this sort of &ldquo;flip&rdquo; whereby you assign the readings as homework then ask students to come to class prepared to discuss it, not to listen to lecture.)</p>
<p>One of the great benefits of the growing popularity and adoption of the &ldquo;flipped classroom&rdquo; this year &mdash; and I will examine some of the criticisms below &mdash; is that it asked teachers and students alike to evaluate how we use the time in the classroom. Are we lecturing? Is there discussion (peer-to-peer, not just student-to-teacher)? Is there hands-on learning? How does technology (re)shape the way we teach and learn? What happens online? What happens face-to-face? How much listening &mdash; and clicking and pausing and fast-forwarding and rewinding &mdash; do we expect our students to do?</p>
<h2>Flipping &ldquo;The Flip&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Despite the buzz about the flipped classroom and its promotoin as the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/09/move-over-harvard-and-mit-stanford-has-the-real-revolution-in-education/">&ldquo;real revolution</a>&rdquo; in learning, there has been plenty of pushback and lots of questioning this year about what exactly this practice entails. What expectations and assumptions are we making about students&rsquo; technology access at home when we assign them online videos to watch? Why are video-taped lectures so &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; if lectures themselves are so not? (As Karim Ani, founder of Mathalicious pointed out <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/khan-academy-the-hype-and-the-reality/2012/07/22/gJQAuw4J3W_blog.html">in a Washington Post op-ed</a> this summer, &ldquo;Experienced educators are concerned that when bad teaching happens in the classroom, it&rsquo;s a crisis; but that when it happens on YouTube, it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;revolution.&rsquo;&rdquo;)</p>
<p>And how much of the whole &ldquo;flipped classroom&rdquo; model is based on the practice of homework that is dubious at best and onerous at worst? As education author <a href="http://www.alfiekohn.org/books/hm.htm">Alfie Kohn</a> has long argued, homework represents a &ldquo;second shift&rdquo; for students, and there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alfie-kohn/homework-research_b_2184918.html">little research</a> to suggest they get much out of it &mdash; whether they&rsquo;re watching videos or filling out worksheets after school. Gary Stager too has been highly critical of the practice (you can read his recent <a href="http://storify.com/garystager/gary-stager-raises-questions-about-the-flipped-cla">Storify of his tweets on the topic</a>): &ldquo;I believe teachers who lecture should be remediated,&rdquo; he tweeted. Now <em>that&rsquo;s</em> a flip.</p>
<p>And as the year rolls to a close, some teachers who&rsquo;ve experimented with flipping their classrooms are evaluating the practices and questioning the hype about its transformative potential. Shelley Wright, for example, had <a href="http://plpnetwork.com/2011/07/25/the-flip-why-i-love-it-how-i-use-it/">written a blog post last year</a> about why she loved &ldquo;the flip.&rdquo; But by October of 2012, she&rsquo;d penned another: &ldquo;<a href="http://plpnetwork.com/2012/10/08/flip-love-affair/">The Flip: The End of a Love Affair</a>.&rdquo; She noted that she didn&rsquo;t really disagree with anything she&rsquo;d said last year, but that flipping the classroom &ldquo;simply didn&rsquo;t produce the tranformative learning experience I knew I wanted for my students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about fads &ndash; it&rsquo;s about ownership,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that inquiry &amp; PBL learning can be incredibly powerful in the hands of students. I would never teach any other way again. When students own their learning, then deep, authentic, transformative things happen in a classroom. It has nothing to do with videos, or homework, or the latest fad in education. It has everything to do with who owns the learning.</p>
<p>For me, the question really is: who owns the learning in your classroom?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that question is likely to lead to an incredibly powerful &ldquo;flip&rdquo; &mdash; one that isn&rsquo;t about video-based lectures assigned after school, but about flipping the classroom away from the focus on teachers&rsquo; control of content and towards student inquiry and agency. (Here's hoping that's a trend I get to talk about in 2013.)</p>
