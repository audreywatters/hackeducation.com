<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 4 of my <a href="http://2012trends.hackeducation.com">Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2012</a> series</em></p>

<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/khanacademy150.jpg" alt="" align="right" />&ldquo;Flipping the classroom&rdquo; is hardly new. But with all the hype surrounding both <a href="http://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> and MOOCs, it&rsquo;s hardly surprising that the practice became incredibly popular this year.</p>

<p>Indeed, in his <a href="http://youtu.be/gM95HHI4gLk">2011 TED Talk</a> (which has been watched over 2 million times on YouTube), Salman Khan talked about the ways in which his videos are used by teachers to &ldquo;flip the classroom.&rdquo; That is, in lieu of teachers lecturing in the classroom, the Khan Academy video lectures are assigned as homework; then students work on exercises in class where the teacher can more easily assist and remediate. &ldquo;Flipping the classroom&rdquo; has become a crucial part of the story that Khan repeats in his frequent talks and media appearances.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also become part of the argument that <a href="http://coursera.com">Coursera</a> co-founder Daphne Koller makes about how massive open online classes or MOOCs (which, duh, is another huge ed-tech trend of 2012) will change the offline university experience. When Coursera launched in April, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/04/18/coursera/">she told me</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a growing amount of content out there on the Web,&rdquo; says Koller, &ldquo;and so the value proposition for the university is no longer simply getting their content out there. Rather, it&rsquo;s fostering that personal interaction between faculty and students and students and students.&rdquo; By being able to take advantage of online educational content &ndash; particularly lecture content from some of the best professors at the most pretigious universities in the world &ndash; students will benefit too. It&rsquo;ll mean that the university classroom can be &ldquo;flipped&rdquo; &ndash; with lectures pre-recorded and assigned as homework. Koller, who&rsquo;s been flipping her classroom since well before Khan Academy popularized the term, says that universities have been reluctant to add &ldquo;active learning&rdquo; opportunities at expense of covering &ldquo;the curriculum&rdquo; via lecture. And thanks to the increasing wealth of online classes, there&rsquo;ll be more opportunities for hands-on on-campus experiences.</p>
<br />
<p>And in turn, by making that content available &ndash; freely and openly on the Web &ndash; that will mean a &ldquo;better education for everyone,&rdquo; say Ng and Keller.</p>
