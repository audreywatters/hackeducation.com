<p>I've been working today on another post in my series on <a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=open%20educational%20resources">open education resources</a>, tackling the issue of confusion around licensing and usage that I'd like to argue has some bearing on the adoption of OER. So it was fairly timely, I'd say, to have the mis-appropriation ("mis-aggregation") of a bunch of education blogs' posts noticed, blasted, attributed, then yanked from the Web. I decided to Storify things -- and shelve the longer story on licensing challenges 'til tomorrow.</p>
