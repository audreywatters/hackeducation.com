<p>Interactive textbook publisher <a href="http://inkling.com">Inkling</a> announced today that it&rsquo;s struck a distribution partnership with Follett, the largest college bookstore retailer in the industry. Follett, which operates some 900 college bookstores, says it will make &ldquo;hundreds of titles&rdquo; from Inkling available to its customers in the fall.</p>
<p>Students will be able to buy the Inkling titles online or in their local bookstores, using multiple payment methods including financial aid. They&rsquo;ll also be able to take advantage of Inkling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pick 3&rdquo; pricing alternative whereby students can opt to just purchase 3 digital chapters rather than an entire textbook.</p>
<p>Follett boasts some 5 million students across the campus bookstores it serves, and that number clearly bodes well for Inkling which will now have its brand and app in front of these potential customers.</p>
<p>But the operative word here might be &ldquo;app,&rdquo; as Inkling remains iPad only. The startup does say that an HTML5 Web app is in the works, but until then, its titles all remain bundled with a rather expensive piece of hardware. That&rsquo;s not to say that college students don&rsquo;t have or want iPads, of course. (They do.) But nor does that iDevice desire or ownership mean they necessarily want digital textbooks either. (Students&rsquo; attitudes towards them remain <a href="http://site.ebrary.com/lib/surveys/home.action">lukewarm</a>.)</p>
