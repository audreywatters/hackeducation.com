<p>A devastating <strong>tornado</strong> razed much of Moore, <strong>Oklahoma</strong> on Monday, killing 24 people, including 7 children who were in the elementary schools that were <a href="http://www.psmag.com/politics/do-cheap-mid-century-schoolhouses-worsen-disasters-like-the-moore-tornado-58332">destroyed</a>.

<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <strong>Chicago</strong> Public Schools Board of Education &mdash; appointees of Mayor Rahm Emanuel &mdash; <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-23/news/chi-chicago-school-closings-20130522_1_chicago-teachers-union-byrd-bennett-one-high-school-program">voted</a> to close 49 schools in the city, the biggest single mass closure of schools in the nation&rsquo;s history. A federal judge has scheduled hearings in July to decide whether to proceed with the closures after the Chicago Teachers Union filed suits alleging racial discrimination and a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Zing!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The US House of Representatives <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/us/politics/house-passes-student-loan-bill-setting-up-showdown.html">passed</a> a <strong>student loan bill</strong> that would stop interest rates from doubling on July 1. Yay. Instead, the bill would tie rates to prevailing market trends. Boo.</p>
<p>The Government Accountability Office (<strong>GAO</strong>) reports that in the past two school years, 40 states have detected potential <strong>cheating</strong> on <strong>standardized tests</strong>. More details in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/gao-40-states-have-suspected-cheating-on-k-12-tests/2013/05/17/a366542c-bf1d-11e2-97d4-a479289a31f9_story.html">The Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newschools.org/blog/great-act-introduced-before-house-and-senate">NewSchools Venture Fund</a> covers its <a href="http://www.newschools.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/13-0523-GREAT_Act_Supporters.pdf">support</a> for the <strong>Growing Excellent Achievement Training Academies for Teachers and Principals (GREAT) Act</strong>, introduced in the House and Senate this week. The <a href="http://www.bennet.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/bennet-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-create-academies-that-prepare-great-teachers-and-principals">bill</a> would create new kinds of teacher and principal preparation programs. <a href="http://www.bennet.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/bennet-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-create-academies-that-prepare-great-teachers-and-principals">Similar legislation</a> has been proposed, but has failed to pass, before.</p>
<p>The <strong>Wisconsin</strong> state legislature has moved to strip the funding stream of the <strong>United Council</strong>, &ldquo;the nation&rsquo;s oldest and most respected statewide student association,&rdquo; says historian Angus Johnston, who has more details about the move and the politics behind it <a href="http://studentactivism.net/2013/05/24/saveuc-2/">on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>PƒÅvels Jurs, a teacher in <strong>Latvia</strong>, was arrested last week for uploading a scanned copy of a high school history textbook to his website &mdash; a website that he created to help poor students have access to educational materials; a book that sells for $4. According to <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/police-raid-school-teacher-for-uploading-history-book-for-students-130520/">TorrentFreak</a>, Jurs might face up to two years in jail for his crime.</p>
<p>Despite the State Supreme Court decision <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/05/10/hack-education-weekly-news-5-10-2013/">earlier this month</a> that deemed the funding for <strong>Louisiana</strong>&rsquo;s <strong>voucher</strong> program unconstitutional, the State Superintendent of Education says he&rsquo;ll &ldquo;push ahead with a plan to let students take classes from private firms and nonprofits at taxpayers&rsquo; expense.&rdquo; More details via <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/24/usa-education-choice-idUSL2N0E512Y20130524">Reuters</a>.</p>

For the five different types of personal information that we measured in both 2006 and 2012, each is significantly more likely to be shared by teen social media users in our most recent survey.&rdquo; Teens&rsquo; use of <strong>Twitter</strong> has grown and while their enthusiasm for <strong>Facebook</strong> seems to be waning.</p>
<p>According to a report released this week by the Century Foundation, funding for <strong>community colleges</strong> is on the decline creating a situation that is &ldquo;separate and unequal.&rdquo; According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/education/2-year-colleges-getting-a-falling-share-of-spending.html">The New York Times article</a> on the report, &ldquo;in 2009, community colleges spent $9,300 per student on educational resources, virtually unchanged from 1999 once inflation was taken into account.
