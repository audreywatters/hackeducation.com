<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>This week, we chatted about:</p>
<p><strong>0:22</strong> - My <a href="http://hackeducation.com/news">new addition to the Hack Education site</a>, where I'm curating and commenting on some of the education blog posts I've read.</p>
<p><strong>2:17</strong> - <a href="/2012/05/07/when-school-internet-filters-follow-you-home-cipa/">Confusion over CIPA</a>, and the growing reach of schools' filters that are now following students and teachers home.</p>
<p><strong>11:19</strong> - <a href="/2012/05/09/5-things-ive-learned-from-moocs-about-how-i-learn-/">What I've learned about how I learn</a>, thanks (in part) to being a serial MOOC dropout. &nbsp;(Also, I pronounce Udacity as "you-da-city." &nbsp;I blame the folks on the <a href="http://digitalcampus.tv/">Digital Campus</a> podcast, which I recorded earlier Friday morning.)</p>
<p><strong>17:00</strong> - Mathalicious takes to fundraising on Kickstarter, and I ask "<a href="/2012/05/10/mathalicious-kickstarter/">Why</a>?"</p>
