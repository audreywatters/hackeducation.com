<p>I'm thrilled to announce that <a href="http://www.stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I have started recording a podcast together, based on my <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/weekly-roundup/">weekly roundup</a> posts and on the stories I've covered throughout the week here on Hack Education.</p>
<p>It's a huge honor to be working with Steve on this endeavor as I see him as one of the key people who's pioneered the adoption of social networking tools for teachers and students, who's argued for the importance of edu-blogging, and who's long supported open source technology in education.</p>
<p>We make a good podcasting team too, even though this first episode runs a little long (that's an indication of our enthusiasm for this new project, I think).</p>
<p>You can listen to the first episode <a href="http://audio.edtechlive.com/cr20/2011-10-14.mp3">here</a>.  That's a direct link to the mp3 -- I'll update this once we have the feed subscription squared away.</p>
