<h2>Education and the Law</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/03/court-grants-temporary-reprieve-city-college-san-francisco">Inside Higher Ed reports</a> that a San Francisco Superior Court judge has granted a partial injunction to block the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) from revoking the accreditation of the <strong>City College of San Francisco</strong>. (As I noted in <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/12/19/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-credits/">one of my year-end review posts</a>, I predict this and other accreditation battles will dominate the headlines in 2014.)</p>
<p>As promised, the <strong>Author&rsquo;s Guild</strong> has <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/60492-authors-guild-appeals-google-decision.html">filed</a> a notice of appeal of the recent US District Court decision in the <strong>Google</strong> book-scanning case, which Judge Denny Chin dismissed late last year.</p>
<p>A North Carolina grand jury has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/sports/as-for-athletes-but-charges-of-tar-heel-fraud.html">indicted</a> professor Julius Nyang&rsquo;oro for &ldquo;unlawfully, willfully and feloniously&rdquo; accepting payment &ldquo;with the intent to cheat and defraud&rdquo; the university. Nyang&rsquo;oro &ldquo;taught&rdquo; a <strong>University of North Carolina</strong> class AFAM 280 during the summer of 2011. But according to the charges, the course never met. The 19 students enrolled in it were football players, &ldquo;reportedly steered there by academic advisers who saw their roles as helping athletes maintain high enough grades to remain eligible to play.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Education Politics and Policies</h2>
<p>New York City&rsquo;s new mayor <strong>Bill de Blasio</strong> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/nyregion/de-blasio-is-said-to-choose-schools-chancellor.html">named</a> <strong>Carmen Fari&ntilde;a</strong> as his schools chancellor. Fari&ntilde;a has been a teacher, a principal, and a superintendent.</p>
<p>The <strong>Kansas Board of Regents</strong> will <a href="http://www.6newslawrence.com/news/education/8308-kansas-board-of-regents-to-reconsider-new-social-media-policy">reconsider</a> its new <strong>social media policy</strong>, in the wake of controversy over the policy&rsquo;s reach and anti-free speech implications.</p>
<p>The <strong>Texas Education Agency</strong> has expanded its investigation into the <strong>Prime Prep Academy</strong>, a charter school co-founded by former NFL star <strong>Deion Sanders</strong>, <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20131231-state-agency-expands-investigation-into-charter-school-co-founded-by-deion-sanders.ece">reports the Dallas Morning News</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/us/loan-monitor-is-accused-of-ruthless-tactics-on-student-debt.html">The New York Times examines</a> the &ldquo;ruthless tactics&rdquo; of the <strong>Educational Credit Management Corporation</strong>, the company hired by the Department of Education &ldquo;to fight student debtors who file for bankruptcy on federal loans.&rdquo; According to a panel of bankruptcy appeals judges, its collections activities &ldquo;constituted an abuse of the bankruptcy process and defiance of the court&rsquo;s authority.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Upgrades</h2>
<p>Version 2 of the <strong><a href="http://peeragogy.org/">Peeragogy Handbook</a></strong> &ndash; a guide for tech-enhanced collaborative learning, edited by <a href="http://rheingold.com/">Howard Rheingold</a> &ndash; was released January 1. And released into the public domain to boot.</p>
<p>The <strong>LA Makerspace</strong> has <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tara/los-angeles-makerspace-a-family-friendly-innovatio">found a new home</a>, inside the LA Public Library&rsquo;s Koreatown Pio-Pico branch.</p>
<h2>Pivots</h2>
<p><strong>Kaggle</strong>, a data startup that initially hosted data mining and machine learning competitions, has pivoted, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/big-data-shrinks-to-grow/">according to The New York Times</a>. (Kaggle was host to the Hewlett Foundation&rsquo;s automatic essay-grading contest <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/09/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-education-data-and-learning-analytics/">in 2012</a>.) Kaggle will now focus on big data services for the oil and gas industry. Because oil data is <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/10/17/student-data-is-the-new-oil/">the new oil</a>, I guess.</p>
<h2>Patents</h2>
<p><strong>Jaron Lanier</strong>, the virtual reality pioneer who&rsquo;s become increasingly disillusioned with the direction that technology has taken, has been granted a <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2013/0346310.html">patent</a> for a &ldquo;Privacy Enhancing Personal Data Brokerage Service.&rdquo; The patent has been assigned to <strong>Microsoft</strong>. So that&rsquo;s, um, interesting.</p>
<h2>A MOOC</h2>
<p><strong>Dave Cormier</strong> (the person we get to blame for the &ldquo;MOOC&rdquo; acronym) will be kicking off an open course on <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/882/rhizomatic-learning-the-community-is-the-curriculum/">rhizomatic learning</a>. &ldquo;Broadly speaking rhizomatic learning is the way I think about learning in an age of abundance. It is based on the work of many folks, but primarily in my somewhat idiosyncratic reading of Deleuze and Guattari&rsquo;s concept of the rhizome from their very idiosyncratic work &lsquo;A Thousand Plateaus&rsquo;.&rdquo; <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/882/rhizomatic-learning-the-community-is-the-curriculum/">The course starts January 14</a>.</p>
<h2>Not a MOOC</h2>
<p><strong>Prince William</strong> will <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25552545">take a course</a> in agricultural management at <strong>Cambridge University</strong>. He &ldquo;will have 18 to 20 hours of lectures, seminars and meetings a week, as well as essays to complete and field trips to attend.&rdquo; Was there no MOOC, Will? Or did you get a special deal on Cambridge fees as the Duke of Cambridge?</p>
<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>PandoDaily <a href="http://pando.com/2013/12/30/neverware-raises-4-1-million-for-reviving-old-school-computers/">reports</a> that <strong>Neverware</strong> has raised $3 million in equity funding. The startup makes a virtualization device that helps schools use old computers like they were new ones.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p>The Pew Internet and American Life Project issued its &ldquo;<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Social-Media-Update.aspx">Social Media Update 2013</a>&rdquo; report at the end of the year. Among the findings: &ldquo;some 73% of online adults use a social networking site of some kind.&rdquo; And while <strong>Facebook</strong> remains popular, many users are &ldquo;diversifying onto other platforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whiter the school, the more <strong>diversity</strong> depicted in the [<strong>college admissions</strong>] brochures,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/12/29/257765543/a-campus-more-colorful-than-reality-beware-that-college-brochure">according to research</a> by Augsburg College sociologist Tim Pippert.</p>
<p>Barbara Ericson has <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2014/01/01/detailed-ap-cs-2013-results-unfortunately-much-the-same/">compiled data</a> on the 2013 <strong>Computer Science AP exam</strong>. Among her findings: &ldquo;No females took the exam in Mississippi, Montana, and Wyoming.&rdquo; And &ldquo;11 states had no Black students take the exam: Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.&rdquo;</p>
