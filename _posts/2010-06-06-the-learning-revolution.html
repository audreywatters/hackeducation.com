<p>Sir Ken Robinson's February <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/" target="_blank">TED talk</a> is finally available online.</p>
<p>He begins by speaking of a second climate crisis we face: a "crisis of human resources." He goes on to point to the ways in which the education system "dislocates people from their natural talents." Arguing that we have to create the space for those talents to be uncovered and cultivated, Robinson argues that education reform is not enough.</p>
<p>We need an education revolution. Robinson criticizes our industrial education model -- with its emphasis on linearity and conformity -- and suggests instead that we develop an agrarian model, one that would embrace learning as organic and that would create the conditions for learning to flourish.</p>
