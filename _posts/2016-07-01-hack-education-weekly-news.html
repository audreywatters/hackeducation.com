<p>Well the UK&#8217;s <strong>Brexit</strong> shitshow continues, with all sorts of machinations this past week about who&#8217;ll be the new PM. Not Brexit campaign leader Boris Johnson, apparently. Perhaps the new Prime Minister will be fellow "leave" supporter <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, who betrayed Johnson this week (or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/29/michael-gove-sarah-vine-leaked-email">Gove&#8217;s wife did</a>, at least). You&#8217;ll remember Gove, of course, from his role as the former education secretary and as special <a href="https://youtu.be/PBtooLmig2c">friend</a> of News Corp's Joel Klein. Or perhaps you&#8217;ll remember him from <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/please-take-a-moment-to-enjoy-this-vine-of-michael-gove-fall?utm_term=.gpXlebgm8#.kp7KdaxDX">this Vine</a>:</p>
