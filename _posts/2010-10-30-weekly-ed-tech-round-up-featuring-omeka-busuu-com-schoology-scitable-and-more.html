<p>Online language learning community <a href="http://busuu.com">busuu.com</a> has entered into a <a href="http://blog.busuu.com/busuu-com-enters-into-strategic-partnership-with-leading-language-learning-publisher-collins/">strategic partnership</a> with the publisher Collins.  The partnership involves Grammar Guides (for Spanish, French, German, Italian) integrated into the platform at a cost of �7,99 for premium users and �9,99 for free users of the site.  busuu.com says that in the future, the two companies will be working together on more courses.</p>
<p>The open source content management system <a href="http://omeka.org">Omeka</a> is now offering a hosted version of its software.  Much like Wordpress.com has made it easy for folks who aren't able to install WordPress on their own servers to have blogs, <a href="http://omeka.net">Omeka.net</a> will make it a lot easier for folks to get their online archives and digital collections up and running.  Here's my <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/omeka_launches_a_hosted_platform_to_move_museums_t.php">ReadWriteWeb write-up</a> on the news.</p>
<p>Science education site <a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable">Scitable</a> has added several new content areas, including Cell Biology, Ecology, English Communication for Scientists, and the Guide to Careers in Life Sciences.</p>
<p>College calendaring system <a href="http://www.dormnoise.com">DormNoise</a> has added a bunch of new features with the start of the school year, including integration with Facebook so that you can  use DormNoise without leaving Facebook.</p>
<p>And speaking of not leaving Facebook, the London School of Business and Finance will offer a Facebook app that allows you to do your MBA coursework while on the social networking site.  Here's my <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/study_for_your_mba_via_a_facebook_app.php">ReadWriteWeb story</a>, in which I kept the snark to the minimum.</p>
<p>The Chronicle <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/new-at-itunes-u-free-e-books/27957">reports</a> that you can now get free eBooks via the iTunes University.  iTunes has also created a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/apple_adds_special_education_section_to_the_app_st.php">Special Education section</a> in its app store.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_acquires_file_sharing_and_collaboration_s.php">Facebook has acquired Drop.io</a>.  As <a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2010/10/dropio-acquired-by-facebook-get-your.html">Richard Byrne</a> notes, if you have been a Drop.io user, the time is now to get your stuff out as the service will shut down before the end of the year.</p>
<p>I had a chance to swing by <a href="http://www.schoology.com">Schoology</a>'s offices when I was in New York City this week.  Schoology has built a really nice looking LMS, that seems to understand both the demands of educators and students. You can read my ReadWriteWeb story <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/schoology_aims_to_fix_one_of_the_greatest_pain_poi.php">here</a>.</p>
