<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of <strong>Chicago</strong> this week to protest the city&rsquo;s plans to <strong>close</strong> 53 elementary schools and one high school. <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/03/27/175524955/in-chicago-dozens-arrested-as-they-protest-school-closures">Dozens were arrested</a>. African American students account for <a href="http://raniakhalek.com/2013/03/27/public-education-is-being-dismantled-on-the-backs-of-black-and-brown-children/">90%</a> of those affected by school closings, even though they make up just 42% of the public school student population. For more details, see <a href="http://schoolcuts.org/">School Cuts</a>, a website that uses the city&rsquo;s open data to share more information (including student body demographics) on the schools affected by the impending closures.</p>
<p>The <strong>Texas</strong> House <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/news/heated-debate-in-texas-house-over-testing-graduati/nW4qF/">voted</a> 145&ndash;2 to reduce <strong>high-stakes testing</strong> in the state. Currently students in Texas are required to take 15 high-stakes tests in order to graduate; the new law would only require 5, in algebra, biology, U.S. history and 10th-grade reading and writing.</p>
<p><strong>President Obama</strong> <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/138171/">signed a bill</a> to fund government operations for the rest of the fiscal year. It will also restore tuition aid for the <strong>military</strong> and limit <strong>NSF</strong> funding for political science research.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong> governor Chris Christie <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/25/camden-schools-takeover/2017259/">announced</a> this week that the state is assuming control of the <strong>Camden City School District</strong>, pointing to the district&rsquo;s low graduation rate and students&rsquo; poor academic performance. Thanks to <a href="http://shankerblog.org/?p=7995">Matthew Di Carlo from the Shanker Institute</a> for a clear look at the data: &ldquo;NJ officials have justified their decision to the public based in large part on the argument that Camden schools are severely ineffective, but their evidence doesn&rsquo;t really come close to supporting that conclusion.&rdquo; Maybe there&rsquo;s a tech CEO that can donate $100 million to the state to help?</p>
<p>HEY! <strong>Facebook</strong> founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is exploring forming a <strong>SuperPAC</strong>, <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/nov05election/2013/03/22/excloo-silicon-valleys-newest-start-up-zuckerberg-tech-stars-explore-multi-million-superpac-to-push-immigration-issues/">according to SFGate</a>, that will target a number of issues including immigration and education reform. &ldquo;Sources say the group is bringing on Jon Lerner, the Republican strategist who founded Maryland-based Red Sea LLC and who is behind the conservative Club for Growth. Joining him will be ultra-conservative GOP consultant Rob Jesmer, a former strategist with Texas Sen. John Cornyn and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m gonna go reread Zuck&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2012/02/zuck-letter/">The Hacker Way</a>&rdquo; to see what it says about SuperPACs&hellip;</p>
<p>Legislation in <strong>North Carolina</strong> will force schools tono use <strong>digital materials</strong> in lieu of printed textbooks by 2017. Schools will be allowed to spend money that&rsquo;s been allocated for textbooks on technology. But according to the <a href="http://www.fayobserver.com/articles/2013/03/28/1246062">Fayobserver.com</a>, the state has slashed textbook funding in order to balance the budget, and there isn&rsquo;t any money earmarked for devices. Sounds like a winning plan.</p>
<p>The <strong>Department of Justice</strong> <a href="http://legalclips.nsba.org/?p=19055">has reached an agreement</a> with the Meridian Public School District in <strong>Mississippi</strong> &ldquo;to end harsh disciplinary practices in which black students face harsher punishment than whites for similar misbehavior. The agreement comes after a lengthy federal investigation that found that black public school students in Meridian are five times more likely than whites to be suspended from classes and often got longer suspensions for comparable misbehavior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>U.S. Supreme Court</strong> has <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/03/26/supreme-court-takes-another-case-involving-affirmative-action-and-higher-education">agreed</a> to take on another <strong>affirmative action</strong> in higher ed case, stemming from a Michigan referendum that banned public universities in the state from considering race in admissions decisions. (Lower courts have ruled that this was unconstitutional.) The Court is also considering <em>Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin</em> this term.</p>
<p>The Atlanta Journal Constitution <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/charges-expected-in-aps-test-cheating-scandal/nW35q/">reports</a> that Fulton County prosecutors are close to seeking indictments stemming from <strong>test-cheating</strong> uncovered in the <strong>Atlanta Public Schools</strong>. &ldquo;In July 2011, three special investigators found cheating on standardized tests occurred at 44 Atlanta schools and involved 178 educators, including 38 principals.&rdquo; Lawyers close to the probe say &ldquo;a large number of people&rdquo; could be indicted. UPDATE: while I was penning this post, <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/former-attorney-general-arrives-for-grand-jury-tes/nW7L2/">the news crossed the wire</a>.&nbsp;<span>Former Atlanta school Superintendent Beverly Hall has been indicted on 65 counts. She and 34 others have been charged with racketeering.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/03/28/tennessee-bill-parents-pay-back-welfare-students-fail">A proposed bill in <strong>Tennessee</strong></a> would cut a family&rsquo;s <strong>welfare</strong> benefits by 30% if a child fails a grade. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really just something to try to get parents involved with their kids,&rdquo; said the bill&rsquo;s sponsor, state Senator Stacey Campfield, who has no plans to punish affluent families for poor school performance.</p>
<p><strong>The Scholarly Kitchen</strong> blog <a href="http://www.infodocket.com/2013/03/29/the-scholarly-kitchen-removes-posts-re-edwin-mellen-publishers-threatens-comment-author-with-lawsuit/">has taken down posts</a> relating to <strong>Edwin Mellen Publishers</strong>, after receiving legal threats from the company. The posts in question deal with the publisher&rsquo;s lawsuits against librarian Dale Askey and McMaster University (EMP is suing Askey for libel, based on negative reviews about it.) To make an unfortunate story even odder, <a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2013/03/roy-tennant-digital-libraries/the-strange-case-of-edwin-mellen-press/">some sleuthing</a> has uncovered that the publisher has registered domain names relating to Askey, including DaleAskey.com.</p>
<h2>Vagina Vagina Vagina Vagina</h2>
<p><a href="http://magicvalley.com/news/local/state-investigates-complaint-about-dietrich-science-teacher-s-human-reproduction/article_47dec69a-963f-11e2-a856-001a4bcf887a.html">An <strong>Idaho</strong> high school biology teacher</a> is being investigated by the state&rsquo;s professional standards commission after complaints from 4 parents that he said &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/03/high-school-sex-ed-teacher-being-punished-saying-word-vagina/63617/">vagina</a>&rdquo; during a lesson on <strong>human reproduction</strong>. Apparently the teacher also showed <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> in class, so clearly he&rsquo;s a dangerous, science-y sort. .</p>
<h2>Launches and Upgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Dave Winer</strong>, podcasting and blogging pioneer and developer of RSS, has a new company, Small Pictures, which released its first product this week: <strong><a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner</a></strong>. As the name would suggest, the browser-based tool is great for outlining writing projects.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> <a href="http://google-africa.blogspot.com/2013/03/announcing-new-tv-white-spaces-trial-in.html">announced</a> a trial that will use white space (that is, unused TV spectrum) to distribute broadband Internet to schools in South Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Kuato Studios</strong> has launched an iPad game called Hakitzu that teaches JavaScript. Wired&rsquo;s GeekMom blog has a <a href="http://www.wired.com/geekmom/2013/03/hakitzu-gaming-learning/">review</a> of the game. (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id599976903">iTunes link</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2013/03/ebooks/penguin-lifts-library-ebook-purchase-embargo/"><strong>Pearson</strong> says</a> that it will allow libraries to purchase and lend <strong>Penguin</strong> e-books. So thoughtful.</p>
<h2>Closures</h2>
<p><strong>Tinkercad</strong>, a browser-based 3D CAD tool (often used in conjunction with 3D printing), is <a href="https://tinkercad.com/">closing down</a>. All academic accounts will be switched to read-only, effective August 31, 2013.</p>
<h2>Departures</h2>
<p>The digital textbook startup&nbsp;<strong>Boundless</strong>&nbsp;is losing another co-founder, as&nbsp;<a href="http://restrictionisexpression.com/post/46267346562/big-changes">CTO Aaron White</a>&nbsp;says he&rsquo;s stepping down from the company. (Another co-founder, Brian Balfour, departed last year.) The third co-founder, CEO Arial Diaz, remains (as does the<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/oer-textbook-startup-sued-publishers-copyright-infringement">lawsuit</a>&nbsp;from the publishing industry, charging the startup with copyright infringement.)</p>
<p><strong>Wikimedia Foundation</strong>&nbsp;executive director Sue Gardner is&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/03/27/sue-gardner-departure-announcement/">stepping down</a>. The Wikimedia Foundation is the non-profit that manages Wikipedia.</p>
<h2>Obligatory MOOC Section</h2>
<p><strong>Harvard</strong> is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/education/harvard-asks-alumni-to-donate-time-to-free-online-course.html">asking its alumni</a> to donate their time as online mentors and discussion group facilitators on the <strong>edX</strong> platform. Because, ya know, the <a href="http://thenewfacultymajority.blogspot.com/">adjunctification of higher education</a> wasn&rsquo;t bad enough; let&rsquo;s have TAs work for free!</p>
<p><strong>Udacity</strong> is <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2013/03/course-pods-new-way-to-connect-with.html">piloting Course Pods</a>, &ldquo;in-person tutorials for online courses&rdquo; beginning with its Intro to Computer Science class. The Course Pods will meet once a week for an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> has funded an associate professor in the <strong>Indiana University School of Education</strong> to develop a new acronym &mdash; a BOOC or &ldquo;Big Open Online Course.&rdquo; No, I jest. Google has given Professor Daniel Hickey a $50,000 grant to offer a class titled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.remediatingassessment.blogspot.com/">Assessment Practices, Principles and Policies</a>,&rdquo; which will use Google&rsquo;s CourseBuilder platform and be open to 500 students.</p>
<h2>Non-MOOC Class News</h2>
<p><strong>The University of Washington</strong> will offer its first online-only degree program, reports <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2013/university-washington-offer-onlineonly-degree-program/">GeekWire</a>. The Early Childhood and Family Studies degree will launch this fall and will cost students $160 per credit.</p>
<p>Enrollment in <strong>California</strong>&rsquo;s community colleges has reached a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0326-college-cuts-20130326,0,163192.story">20-year low</a> and course offerings a 15-year low, thanks to the slashing of the state&rsquo;s education budget.</p>
<h2>Funding and Acquisitions</h2>
<p>EduKwest&rsquo;s Kirsten Winkler <a href="http://www.edukwest.com/babbel-com-raises-10-million-series-b-busuu-and-livemocha-to-follow/">reports</a> that the language-learning site <strong>Babbel</strong> has raised $10 million in a Series B round led by Reed Elsevier Ventures with participation of Nokia Growth Partners. (Babbel was in the news <a href="/2013/03/24/hack-education-weekly-news-3-24-2013/">last week</a> for its acquisition of the mobile app company PlaySay.)</p>
<p>The private student loan group <strong>SoFi</strong> announced that it has &ldquo;secured a $60 million warehouse line from Morgan Stanley.&rdquo; SoFi connects students to alumni who invest in a pool of loans for their alma mater. According to the <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/3/prweb10569154.htm">SoFi press release</a>, &ldquo;This announcement comes two weeks after Sallie Mae, the largest U.S. student lender, sold $1.1 billion of securities backed by private student loans, according to the Wall Street Journal. The popularity of this sale demonstrated investor interest in student loan credit.&rdquo; Wheeeeeee!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=RssLanding&amp;cat=news&amp;id=1801563">Amazon</a></strong> has acquired the social reading site <strong>Goodreads</strong>. <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/03/28/first-do-no-harm-my-interview-with-amazon-and-goodreads-on-the-future-of-goodreads/">PaidContent&rsquo;s Laura Hazard Owen interviewed</a> Amazon and Goodreads execs on the deal. So will Amazon get the Goodreads data? Yup &mdash; another good reminder that we need to ask &ldquo;<a href="/2013/02/26/who-owns-your-education-data-etmooc/">who owns our (education) data</a>?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p>The mean base <strong>salary</strong> for (non-faculty) professionals in higher ed is up 2% from last year, <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/03/25/survey-finds-base-salary-professionals-higher-ed-2-percent">reports Inside Higher Ed</a>. But with a 2.1% rate of inflation, most &ldquo;lost purchasing power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>National Association of State Budget Officers</strong> has released a <a href="http://www.nasbo.org/higher-education-report-2013">report</a> (funded by the Gates Foundation) on the state of <strong>higher ed funding</strong>. According to <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/03/27/state-state-funding-higher-education">Inside Higher Ed</a>, it&nbsp;confirms that &ldquo;that the proportion of state spending going to higher education is lower than in the past, and that per-capita spending on higher education has gone down more than similar spending on prisons and Medicaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to a report from the market research firm Ambient Insight, &ldquo;the <strong>mobile mearning</strong> market in Asia is in a boom phase,&rdquo; with revenues projected to reach $6.8 billion by 2017. The report, which suggests that Asian countries are spending more on mobile learning than on e-learning, will run you $3875, suggesting that the market for white papers is also pretty damn strong.</p>
<p>Although the recent MetLife Survey of the American Teacher found that teachers&rsquo; job satisfaction was at a 25-year low, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/education/in-poll-on-well-being-teachers-rank-high.html">Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index</a> said this week that <strong>teachers are happy</strong> &mdash; or at least &ldquo;teachers ranked above all other professions in answers to questions about whether they &lsquo;smiled or laughed yesterday,&rsquo; as well as whether they experienced happiness and enjoyment the day before the survey.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take the source with a grain of salt here, but <a href="http://m.usatoday.com/article/news/2024709"><strong>Kaplan Test Prep</strong> surveyed students</a> to see if they&rsquo;d prefer to take the SAT on a computer or via the ol&rsquo; No. 2 pencil and paper route. And more than four out of five said they prefer the latter.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/course-load-the-growing-burden-of-college-fees/">ProPublica</a></strong> has published a report investigating the &ldquo;growing burden of <strong>college fees</strong>.&rdquo; Take Auburn University, for example, where mandatory fees &ldquo;now make up 16 percent of an in-state student&rsquo;s combined tuition and fee costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The Brookings Institution</strong> has published a report on &ldquo;<a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/03/20-education-technology-success-west-bleiberg">ed-tech success stories</a>.&rdquo; The successes: robot-assisted language learning, MOOCs, Minecraft, Computerized Adaptive Testing, and stealth assessments. It&rsquo;s always great to read the endnotes on things like this and see what think tanks &ldquo;count&rdquo; as &ldquo;research.&rdquo; In this case, sources where you can learn about ed-tech success include CNET, TIME, PC Gamer, PC Magazine, Forbes, the Minecraft wiki, and Dan Lortie&rsquo;s book <em>Schoolteacher</em>, published in 1975.</p>
