<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>Happy New Year. <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015-12-29/new-california-law-limits-use-of-student-data">From US News &amp; World Report</a>: &#8220;For technology companies in California, ringing in the New Year will mean adjusting to a new privacy law that limits how they can collect and use student data. The data privacy legislation was originally signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2014 and goes into effect Jan. 1. It prohibits the operators of education websites, online services and apps from using any student&#8217;s personal information for targeted advertising or creating a commercial profile, as well as the selling of any student&#8217;s information.&#8221;</p>

It also marks the largest e-rate settlement to date, and includes many compliance plan requirements that could become de facto standards for future E-rate enforcement actions. Further, to the best we can determine, this is the first E-rate enforcement action the Commission has taken against a school or library applicant under the program.&#8221;</p>
