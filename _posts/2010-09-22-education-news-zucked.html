<p><em>A(nother) rant:</em></p>
<p>I don't typically write "the news" for ReadWriteWeb (although that's changing.  Stay tuned for details).  So I don't judge my performance by the number of times I get "Techmeme'd."  <a href="http://www.techmeme.com">Techmeme</a> is a great site for breaking tech news, as it monitors what the leading publications are saying.  The idea is that if you break a big story, you get the Techmeme headline, recognition you wrote the first (or sometimes the best) story... and a little notch on your belt.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do write news, particularly when there's an education-related story, but I've noticed it's always really unlikely that those stories are deemed Techmeme-worthy.  Today, for example, I caught wind of the announcement about <a href="http://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a>'s upcoming changes, and I thought it was a good story.  Admittedly, there's only a small part of the populace that cares about reference tools, but the announcement was enough to warrant a story in <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/zotero_the_best_way_to_cite_your_sources_now_avail.php">RWW</a>, in <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/09/read-and-save-research-with-zotero-everywhere/">Wired</a>, and in the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Zotero-Everywhere-How-Will-it/27037/">Chronicle</a>.  And nary a Techmeme among us.</p>
<p>That's fine.  Whatever.  Not everyone is "OMG PONIES," to quote Julie Meloni, about citation software.</p>
<p>But then, Mark Zuckerberg donates $100 million to Newark schools, and that's a <a href="http://techmeme.com/#a100922p72">Big Story</a>?</p>
<p>OK, yes, I'm bitter and jaded and <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/09/21/media-decides-its-time-for-an-in-depth-conversation-about-education/">deeply suspicious of publicity stunts</a>.</p>
<p>But hey, tune in to Oprah on Friday.  Zuckerberg will be on. And I bet we can TOTALLY fix education if we throw enough talk shows and charitable donations and CEOs at the problem.</p>
