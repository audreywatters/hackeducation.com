<p>Last January, I opted to forego making ed-tech predictions <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/01/01/ed-tech-predictions-2013/">for 2013</a>. I&rsquo;m sticking with that decision again this year.</p>
<p>After all, I&rsquo;ve spent the last 7 or 8 weeks writing at length about what I saw as 2013&rsquo;s <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/12/23/top-ed-tech-trends-2013/">most important ed-tech trends</a>. It&rsquo;s not as though these will cease to be important simply because the calendar has rolled over to 2014.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;important&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing I identified as a &ldquo;top ed-tech trend of 2013&rdquo; (or any year) is inevitable. Not MOOCs. Not iPads. Not adaptive learning. Not Google Glass. Not Khan Academy. Not social media in the classroom. Not ever-bigger ed-tech investments. Not the Web. Not even the Internet.</p>
<p>Oh sure, that&rsquo;s how technological developments are often presented: &ldquo;inevitable, permanent, and natural&rdquo; (a key part of &ldquo;Internet-centrism&rdquo; and &ldquo;technological solutionism,&rdquo; <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/03/26/ed-tech-solutionism-morozov/">says Evgeny Morozov</a>). Technology always progresses &ndash; it <em>is</em> progress, so the story goes &ndash; and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to stop its march. Always forward.</p>
<p>Technology &ndash; personified &ndash; has all the agency in this framework, let&rsquo;s note; actual persons (non-technologists, at least), very little.</p>
<p>But is there really nothing we can do to shape the future?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&ldquo;The best way to predict the future is to invent it.&rdquo; &ndash; Alan Kay</em></p>
<p>Some of the predictions made this time of year tend to be wishes: the things we <em>hope</em> will happen in the coming months. Some predictions do contain more analysis than yearning: assessments made by observing trends and their trajectories. Other predictions lay out clear objectives: the things we <em>will</em> accomplish.</p>
<p>The Alan Kay quote above has been stuck in my head the last few days. (I&rsquo;m working on a keynote I&rsquo;m delivering next month that draws heavily on his work on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook">Dynabook</a>.) I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot lately about the history of the future of ed-tech. Decades and decades of predictions.</p>
<p>Who makes these predictions &ndash; the predictions that we&rsquo;re likely to hear about, repeat, and act upon, that is? Whose predictions appear in major publications? (The &ldquo;5 Tech Experts&rdquo; whose predictions are cited in <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/What-5-Tech-Experts-Expect-in/143829/">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a> this week: a university president, a university CIO, the head of Educause, a consultant, and a Pearson VP. The predictions in <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/guide/edsurge-2014-outlooks">Edsurge&rsquo;s &ldquo;2014 Outlooks&rdquo;</a> include those from CEOs, investors, consultants, a Gates Foundation exec, and a Harvard professor.) Whose predictions appear in epigraphs and PowerPoint presentations ? (&ldquo;Books will soon be obsolete in schools.&rdquo; Thomas Edison, 1913. Heh.) Who&rsquo;s inventing the future of ed-tech? And who&rsquo;s an investor in that future?</p>
<p>For 2014, I see no end in sight to the political battles over the future of education (and ed-tech), despite proclamations from various corners that their &ldquo;side&rdquo; has momentum, despite predictions from various corners that developments will be inevitable. These battles will involve the Common Core State Standards; the hiring and firing and tenure of teachers; challenges to accreditation and the credit hour; the expansion of data collection and data-mining, along with accompanying privacy concerns; expenditures on ed-tech hardware and software and questions - as always - if any of this makes a bit of difference to "outcomes"; the promotion of online education in its MOOC and not-MOOC formats and the ongoing demand for face-to-face and hands-on learning experiences.</p>
<p>All the ed-tech trends of 2013 &ndash; all incredibly fraught, as they will continue to be for years to come.</p>
