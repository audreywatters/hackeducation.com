<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7175/6736158045_6eb22f6d83_n.jpg" alt="Savings" width="240" height="320" align="right" />I am halfway through my year-end series on the <a href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=ed-tech%20trends%202012">Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2012</a>. This is a project that takes me a long time to do &mdash; to review everything that&rsquo;s happened in ed-tech this year and to compile these overviews. I love doing so, as I learn a lot and see things that I mightn&rsquo;t otherwise. And I hope there&rsquo;s value here for my readers.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I&rsquo;d like to remind readers about the <a href="/support.php">&ldquo;donate&rdquo; button</a> on this site.</p>
<p>I purposefully keep Hack Education advertising-free. And unlike most other technology blogs, Hack Education isn&rsquo;t owned by a major technology or media company. I have not taken investment money from the same venture capitalists who fund education/technology companies. I am an independent voice in an increasingly compromised industry.</p>
<p>I believe that a site like this should be crowdfunded, written for the community and in turn supported by the community &mdash; perhaps a bit like NPR (but without the government subsidy clearly, or the corporate sponsorship dollars).</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing here. If you are willing and able, I would very much appreciate your <a href="/support.php">support</a>. Thank you!</p>
