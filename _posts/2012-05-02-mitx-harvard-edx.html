<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/edX_Logo_Col_RGB_FINAL.jpg" alt="" /> <br />This is big news:  Harvard and MIT form a partnership called edX that'll build on the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/02/13/mitx-opens-enrollment/">MITx</a> platform. &nbsp;Harvard plans to start offering courses online for free (with certificates available upon completion -- for a fee). &nbsp;And the two universities launch a research initiative to examine how these sorts of efforts support teaching and learning online and on-campus.</p>
<p>With bonus points for a east coast - west coast rivalry, as well as a university-funded ($60 million)/non-profit versus venture capital funded/for-profit one.</p>
