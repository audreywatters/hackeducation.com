<p>Should all college students be required to take a programming class? &nbsp;I say yes. &nbsp;Most universities already require they take "college composition," based on the assumption that the ability to write coherently and cogently is a necessity. &nbsp;How much longer until we see programming knowledge as a similar sort of required literacy?</p>
<p>I should note here that I'm not saying everyone needs to learn Perl or Python. &nbsp;But I'd say everyone -- yes everyone -- needs to understand how the Web works, how to build a website, how to view "page source" and understand HTML and CSS. &nbsp;And yes, I'd add JavaScript to that list too.</p>
<p>I've got a post over on <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/should-all-majors-not-just-computer-science-majors-learn-code">Inside Higher Ed</a> with some initial thoughts, but I want to push this idea even further in subsequent posts. &nbsp;How would this change how we think about "writing across the curriculum"? &nbsp;And how would it change the way in which we funnel students into (or away from) CS?&nbsp;</p>
