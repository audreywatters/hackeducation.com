<p>Every week (or so), <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news and the stories that I've written here on Hack Education. In this week's recording, we talk about the talks I recently gave at Educon and ELI on the politics of ed-tech and makerspaces on university campuses respectively. We also talk MOOCs, patents, and more.</p>
