<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>Chris Christie was for the Common Core before <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/05/christie_education_post.html">he was against it</a>. (He&#8217;s proposed that New Jersey drop the standards that Christie once pushed for.) <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/chris-christie-denounces-common-core-testing-2016-election-118383.html">As Politico notes</a>, &#8220;The Republican flip-flop on the Common Core is nearly complete,&#8221; with almost every (potential) Republican presidential candidate now opposing the CCSS &#8211; save Jeb Bush.</p>

<p>&#8220;Secretary of Education Arne Duncan sought &#8211; and received &#8211; advice from Jeb Bush about how to deal with Florida Gov. Rick Scott&#8217;s concerns about Common Core, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/ilanbenmeir/jeb-bush-emailed-with-education-secretary-about-rick-scotts#.jmorv5AOr">emails obtained by BuzzFeed News show</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2015/05/newark_students_leave_school_in_protest_block_majo.html">Meanwhile in Newark</a>, thousands of high school students walked out in a major protest of the designation of eight schools as &#8220;turnaround schools.&#8221;</p>

<p>A bill has passed the Michigan Senate that would <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/05/26/bill-okd-to-strip-families-of_ap.html">strip families of welfare benefits</a> if their child misses too much school.</p>

<p>The FCC <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/05/will_changes_to_federal_lifeli.html">might make changes to its &#8220;Lifeline&#8221; program</a>. The program currently helps subsidize phone service for low-income families, and the FCC is weighing whether or not it could help pay for broadband service as well. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/27/education-department-review-clears-loan-companies-overcharging-military-members">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;The U.S. Department of Education said Tuesday that its four main federal student loan servicers, including Navient, have mostly followed the law in granting special interest-rate benefits to members of the military.&#8221; I love that adverb there: &#8220;mostly.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p>A district court judge has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/28/federal-judge-tosses-profit-colleges%E2%80%99-challenge-%E2%80%98gainful-employment%E2%80%99-rule">tossed out a lawsuit</a> filed by for-profit colleges challenging the Obama Administration&#8217;s new &#8220;gainful employment&#8221; rules.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither the legal principle of academic freedom nor the receipt of outside financial support for his work gives a public-college lecturer a right to declare his correspondence private, the University of Kansas argued this week in state court.&#8221; More on the legal battle between the university&#8217;s director of Center for Applied Economics and Students for a Sustainable Future <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/230507/">in The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>.</p>

<h3>RIP</h3>
<br />
<p>Highly influential educator <a href="https://twitter.com/grantwiggins/status/603566671996067840?refsrc=email&amp;s=11">Grant Wiggins passed away suddenly this week</a>. Wiggins was the author of the 1998 book <em>Understanding by Design</em>, which argued that teachers engage in &#8220;backwards design&#8221; &#8211; that is, determine the learning goals and then design their lessons &#8220;backwards&#8221; from there in order to meet those goals.</p>
