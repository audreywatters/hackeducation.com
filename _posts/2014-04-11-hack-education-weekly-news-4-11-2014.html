<p>Oh hey, look. <a href="http://www.thewire.com/technology/2014/04/what-you-need-to-know-about-heartbleed-the-new-security-bug-scaring-the-internet/360366/">The Internet is broken</a>! Or at least, the security of sites using <strong>OpenSSL</strong> has been broken &ndash; for <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/heartbleed-bug-openssl-developer-says-security-flaw-was-simple-mistake-1444348">several years</a> in fact. The bug, which the <strong>NSA</strong> has (shocker!) <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-11/nsa-said-to-have-used-heartbleed-bug-exposing-consumers.html">purportedly exploited</a>, means that encrypted transmissions &ndash; the ones you thought were encrypted? &ndash; are vulnerable. The comic <a href="https://xkcd.com/1353/">xkcd</a> has the best explanation. While the common advice is OMG CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS, it&rsquo;s best to wait to make sure the sites have actually fixed their own vulnerabilities before doing so (<a href="https://lastpass.com/heartbleed/">Check here</a>, for example.)</p>
<h2>Ed-Tech Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>

About 28% of computers still use XP. About 4.4% access the Web via IE6.)</p>
<p><strong>Yahoo</strong> recently broke the CC-attribution in Flickr. Never fear. Folks are <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/04/07/restoring-cc-attribution-to-fl.html">on</a> <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/flickr-cc-helper/">it</a>.</p>
<p>Just when you thought the <strong>LMS</strong> couldn&rsquo;t be any more of a horrible thing to do to students: <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/04/07/keylemon-swissteach-partner-to-demo-facial-recognition-for-lms.aspx">according to Campus Technology</a>, &ldquo;<strong>KeyLemon</strong>, a company that makes <strong>biometric identification tools</strong>, and <strong>SwissTeach</strong> have partnered to demo <strong>facial recognition</strong> on the latter&rsquo;s online learning management system (LMS), Global Teach.&rdquo;</p>
