<p><em>Each week for the past eight or so years, I have gathered a wide variety of links to education and education technology articles. All this has fed the series of articles I have written each December, analyzing <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">the stories we have been told</a> about the future of education. This is the last Hack Education Weekly News of the year because next week I am publishing a very abbreviated review of 2018, and I won&#8217;t need to study in detail what happens each week anymore. I won&#8217;t write the series in 2019 either, so this is the very last Hack Education Weekly News. It&#8217;s time to make some changes to Hack Education and more importantly to my life.</em></p>
