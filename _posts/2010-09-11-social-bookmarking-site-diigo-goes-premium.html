<p>Social bookmarking site <a href="http://www.diigo.com">Diigo</a> announced earlier this week that it was <a href="http://blog.diigo.com/2010/09/06/diigo-releases-premium-accounts/">changing its pricing model</a>, offering premium, ad-free accounts with more features and better support.  Diigo will still offer a free version, as well as a free version for educators, but both of these have some limitations.</p>
<p>In the free version, for example, you can only make 50 highlights per month.  The number of bookmarks is unlimited for all versions.  The premium version offers full-text search and the ability to do screen captures and annotations.</p>
<p>Diigo's move to the freemium business model follows on the heels of <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a>'s announcement in April that it was <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/no_free_lunch_for_ning_users.php">ditching its free version</a> altogether.  The decision to keep the free version and to address educators from the outset is a good move on the part of Diigo, which is likewise a very popular tool among educators.</p>
<p>The premium version will cost $40 per year.</p>
