<p><a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I recorded our last podcast of 2012 today, making our way through the rest of the <a href="/2012/12/20/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012/">Top Ed-Tech Trends</a> that I've written about here on Hack Education over the course of the last few weeks.</p>
<p>As such, this episode covers open textbooks, education data, learning analytics, APIs, platforms, artificial intelligence, and the politics of ed-tech. We also talk briefly about what's missing my from list of "top trends" as well as my picks for the top startups of the year.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Bonus content</strong>: I was a guest on one of <a href="http://www.stevehargadon.com/2012/12/tuesday-interview-adam-frey-on-ed-tech.html">Steve's Ed-Tech Live shows</a> alongside Wikispaces' Adam Frey to discussion success as an education technology entrepreneur. I also appeared in a <a href="http://connectedlearning.tv/steve-hargadon-changing-education-hacking-roots-not-branches">Connected Learning episode</a>, again with Steve, in which we (that is, Steve, Howard Rheingold, Pam Moran, Craig Seasholes and myself) talk about "hacking at the roots" and not the branches of education.</p>
