<p>What a crazy week for US education. Unrelated: I spent the week in Canada.</p>

<p>Harvard MOOCs are in the works, with the big news this week that <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/05/03/harvard-joins-mit-platform-offer-massive-online-courses">Harvard and MIT are teaming up</a> to expand on the latter&rsquo;s MITx platform. The new initiative is called <strong>edX</strong>. <a href="http://shermandorn.com/wordpress/?p=4934">HypeX</a>, observes education professor Sherman Dorn. <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2012/05/02/bionic-mooc/">Bionic</a>, according to Alan Levine. A fairly traditional mother if indeed this is the <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/university-venus/problem-edx">Mother-of-all-MOOCs</a>, suggests Bonnie Stewart.</p>
<p>Michael Feldstein takes a look at the <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/more-on-the-sakaijasig-merger/">proposed merger</a> of the open source <strong>Sakai</strong> and <strong>Jasig</strong> projects to create an Apache-like foundation for higher education.</p>
<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>
<p>The New York City Department of Education issued <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/nyregion/social-media-rules-for-nyc-school-staff-limits-contact-with-students.html">new rules</a> this week for how school employees interact and communicate with students online. The new <strong>social media policy</strong> requires teachers separate professional and personal social media activities and identities. They cannot friend or communicate with students via their personal pages or profiles. Teachers must get their supervisors&rsquo; permission before setting up a professional online identity, where they should have no expectations about privacy. Comments should be turned off on blogs. Administrators will monitor. &nbsp;No word on student-teacher text-messaging, however.&nbsp;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303916904577376541510305510.html">You can read the entire document on The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://legalclips.nsba.org/?p=14147">Portland, Maine will install <strong>filtering software</strong></a> on the laptops it issues its high school students, in order to block access to pornography, streaming video sites, and social networks. These filters will be in effect even when students are using the laptops at home and off the school networks. This goes beyond the mandates of CIPA by <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2011/10/when-school-web-filtering-comes-home/">most interpretations of the law</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="pineapplesandpearson">Pineapples and Pearson</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/28/opinion/collins-a-very-pricey-pineapple.html">The Pineapple-gate saga continues</a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/schoolbook/2012/05/02/state-officials-throw-out-another-pearson-test-question/">The New York Times reports</a> that more questions have been thrown out from the latest Pearson-generated state standardized test in New York. <strong>Pearson</strong> insists its tests are &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/schoolbook/2012/05/04/pearson-says-its-tests-are-valid-and-reliable">valid and reliable</a>.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.eduwonk.com/2012/05/this-weeks-time-pineapplegate-not-as-bad-as-you-think-and-worse.html">leaked memo</a> &ndash; how convenient &ndash; in which Pearson claims this same Pineapple question that everyone's upset about has been used <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2012/05/04/what-everyone-missed-on-the-pineapple-question/">since 2004 in tons of states</a>. See everyone?! &nbsp;It's fine! &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure how that&rsquo;s supposed to reassure New York, which gave the company a $35 million to create it some new tests, but there ya go. More digging finds this old test was &ldquo;<a href="http://dianeravitch.net/2012/05/04/pineapplegate-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving/">normed</a>&rdquo; over a decade ago. &nbsp;Some things, I guess, just don't change.</p>
