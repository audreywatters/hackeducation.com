<blockquote>
<p>Little by little the subversive features of the computer were eroded away: Instead of cutting across and so challenging the very idea of subject boundaries, the computer now defined a new subject; instead of changing the emphasis from impersonal curriculum to excited live exploration by students, the computer was now used to reinforce School&rsquo;s ways. What had started as a subversive instrument of change was neutralized by the system and converted into an instrument of consolidation. -- Seymour Papert, <em>The Children's Machine</em></p>

<p>To assume that technology is going to de facto change school is a form of techno-solutionism. Often, it is techno-solutionism in the form of changing things like perceived "inefficiencies." And that is not a subversive feature of the computer. That's a dominant desire of the managerial class.</p>
