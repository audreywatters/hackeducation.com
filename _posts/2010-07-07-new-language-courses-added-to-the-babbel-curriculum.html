<p>Online language learning company <a href="http://www.babbel.com">Babbel</a> announced today that it was adding <a href="http://www.babbel.com/home/Babbel-Presents-New-Online-Language-Courses">three new language courses</a> to their curriculum:  Beginning Swedish, Beginning Brazilian Portugese, and Advanced English.</p>
<p>Late last month, the Berlin-based company introduced a browser-based <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/babbel_adds_voice_recognition.php">voice recognition tool</a> to help learners with their pronunciation.  The tool is integrated into all the company's language courses.  Babbel also has an iPhone to facilitate language learning on-the-go.</p>
