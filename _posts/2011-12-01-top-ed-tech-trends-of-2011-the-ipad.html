<p><em>Welcome to the first in my year-end series "<a href="http:2011trends.hackeducation.com">Top 10 Ed-Tech Trends of 2011</a>." I've identified some of the most important trends from this year, which I'll be highlighting here over the course of the next few weeks.</em></p>

<p>At the beginning of the year, I made a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/2011_predictions_audrey_watters.php">couple of</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/audrey-watters/is-this-the-year-of-the-e_b_809447.html">pronouncements</a> about this being the Year of the Educational Tablet. I was wrong.</p>

<p>This was the Year of the iPad. Again.</p>

<p>It was clear fairly early in the year that the iPad would be hard to beat -- both commercially and in the classroom. Schools had already indicated a strong interest in the devices during the 2010 academic year, and by the time <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/live-blogging-the-ipad-2-announcement/">Steve Jobs unveiled the iPad 2</a> in March, it felt as though he was merely updating an already well-loved classroom device. Invoking the "crossroads of liberal arts and technology" in his presentation, Job announced an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">updated iPad</a> that had just the sorts of features that educators (among others) had critiqued for being absent in the first iteration: the iPad 2 had a camera, for example. You could record pictures, video, your voice.</p>

<p>The iPad wasn't merely a <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2010/04/04/ipad-danger-app-v-web-consumer-v-creator/">consumption device</a>. People talked about ditching their laptops for tablets at work; schools talked about ditching desktops for tablets too. And thus, if you believe the narrative offered by Steve Jobs, we entered the "post-PC era."</p>

<p>But it was apparent early in the year that other tablet makers were going to have a hard time getting their post-PC devices (the non-iPads) into classrooms. There was no rival Android tablet, no rival Windows tablet to speak of. In <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/02/22/no-kno-not-now-not-ever">February</a>, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/08/kno-raises-46-million-more-to-build-most-powerful-tablet-anyone-has-ever-made/">well-funded and well-hyped</a> <a href="http://kno.com">Kno</a> pivoted from hardware to software, abandoning its plans to build an educational tablet to build instead an e-textbook platform. When Kno <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/06/04/kno-launches-an-ipad-app-but-does-it-stack-up-against-the-e-textbook-competition">launched in June</a>, it was as an iPad app.</p>
