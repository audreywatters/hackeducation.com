<h3>Charlottesville and UVA<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/template_virginia.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>Hundreds of <strong>white supremacists</strong> <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/08/14/white-nationalists-rally-university-virginia">marched</a> at the <strong>University of Virginia</strong> campus Friday night, carrying torches and chanting &#8220;blood and soil.&#8221; On Saturday, the Unite the Right rally met again in the streets of <strong>Charlottesville</strong>. A counter protester was killed when a white nationalist allegedly ran his car into a crowd of people.</p>

<p><strong>President Trump</strong> did not condemn the violence of the white supremacists. Instead he blamed &#8220;both sides,&#8221; later insisting that &#8220;very fine people&#8221; were marching with the neo-Nazis.</p>
