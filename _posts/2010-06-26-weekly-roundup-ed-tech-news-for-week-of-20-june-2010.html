<p>Some of the education technology stories that caught my eye this week:</p>
<li>Online language learning site <strong><a href="http://www.babbel.com">Babbel</a></strong> announced the release of a browser-based voice-recognition tool as part of their language learning packages.  The tool helps correct the pronunciation of students, analyzing their voice and scoring it based on how it compares to a native speaker's. (via <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/babbel_adds_voice_recognition.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com"><strong>Google</strong></a> announced on Friday that in response to problems schools were facing with their new secure search, it would be relocating the encrypted search to a new domain, to avoid conflict with CIPA filtering requirements. (via <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_moves_encrypted_search_to_new_domain.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>)</li>
<li>Music editor <strong>Aviary</strong> announced the beta release of <a href="http://www.aviaryeducation.com/">Aviary Education</a>, which allows teachers to use the Aviary tools in a safe, collaborative workspace with their students. (via <a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2010/06/aviary-for-education-launches-in-beta.html">Free Technology for Teachers</a>)</li>
<li>Social network site <strong><a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a></strong> announced this week that education publisher <a href="http://www.pearson.com/">Pearson</a> has agreed to sponsor Nings for educators.  When Ning ended their freemium model earlier this spring, many in the education community were frustrated as they'd embraced Ning for creating networks with other teachers, with classes, with districts.  The Pearson partnership will allow educators to continue to use the Ning Mini model for free.

<li>Timed perhaps with the release of the newest iPhone and iOS and the promise of having iBooks on it, makers of some of the best known e-reader lowered their prices this week:  <strong>Kindle</strong> $199.  <strong>Nook</strong> $149.  (via <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_e-reader_price_war_heats_up_kindle_now_189.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>)</li>
<li>Lots of friends and former colleagues are in Denver as <strong><a href="http://www.iste.org/2010">ISTE 2010</a></strong> kicks off today. </li>
