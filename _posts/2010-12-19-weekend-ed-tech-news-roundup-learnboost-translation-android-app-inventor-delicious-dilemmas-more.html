<p>Free online gradebook <a href="http://www.learnboost.com">LearnBoost</a> rolled out a translation tool this week.  The startup will <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/learnboost_crowdsources_its_translation_open_sourc.php">crowdsource the translation</a> of its gradebook, a process that will echo Facebook's translation project (but, as to be expected from LearnBoost, with some very cool open source tech on the back end).</p>
<p><a href="http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/">Android App Inventor</a> is now <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/googles_app_inventor_now_open_to_everyone.php">open to everyone</a>.  I've only played with App Inventor a couple of times, but I think it has great potential to open up app-building to those with non-programming backgrounds and to help <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/4_tools_for_teaching_kids_to_code.php">teach kids to code</a>.</p>
<p>Scantron has acquired the online education company <a href="http://www.globalscholar.com/">GlobalScholar</a> for $140 million cash -- another <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/12/11/the-year-in-ed-tech-part-5-investment-in-education-technology/">big ed-tech acquisition</a> to round out 2010.  GlobalScholar describes itself as working "to orchestrate a complete cycle of learning. What begins as driving a unified and properly mapped educational curriculum, passes through robust on-line and off-line assessments, powerful data driven teacher decision support, and a unique platform of enabled differentiated instruction."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a slide leaked from an "all-hands" Yahoo staff meeting, suggesting that the social bookmarking site <a href="http://www.delicious.com">Delicious</a> was going to be shuttered.  <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/deliciouss_data_policy_is_like_setting_a_museum_on.php">The outcry was immediate</a>, and Yahoo later retracted, saying it won't close Delicious (although it's looking to sell).  The damage may have already have been done as most of us are now making <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/12/17/my-post-delicious-plans-and-why-it-wont-include-diigo/">alternate plans</a> to handle our bookmarking, curation, and sharing efforts.</p>
<p>Grading visualization tool <a href="http://knackforteachers.com">Knack for Teachers</a> has relaunched with a number of improvements and new features, including a free trial.</p>
