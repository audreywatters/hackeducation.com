<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34566">British Columbia announced</a> its support for <strong>open textbooks</strong> at the Open Education 2012 conference this week, becoming the first Canadian province to do so. BC will create openly licensed textbooks for the 40 most popular first- and second-year courses in its university system.</p>
<p>Washington voters have rejected ballot measures to allow <strong>charter schools</strong> in the state twice now, but supporters are back again this year with another attempt. They&rsquo;ve raised almost $8.9 million for their campaign, with just 10 donors (including Microsoft&rsquo;s Bill Gates and Amazon&rsquo;s Jeff Bezos) responsible for <a href="http://www.kuow.org/post/10-donors-funded-91-percent-charter-schools-campaign">91%</a> of that money.</p>
<p>Parents in Adelanto California have become <a href="http://hechingered.org/content/parents-choose-new-charter-operator-in-first-ever-parent-trigger_5705/">the first</a> to utilize California&rsquo;s new &ldquo;<strong>Parent Trigger</strong>&rdquo; law to close down their local elementary school and turn it over to a charter school. The parents voted 50 to 3 to have LaVerne Elementary Preparatory Academy take over the Desert Trails Elementary School. Some 600 students and 286 parents signed a petititon last year to convert the school to a charter. Only those parents who signed the petititon were eligible to decide what happened to the school next, which strikes me as profoundly undemocratic and anti-public, but there ya go &mdash; I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/10/18/51402.htm">back to court</a> for the Los Angeles Unified School District and The LA Times. The latter is accusing the district of violating public records laws by refusing to hand over records of teachers&rsquo; performances based on student test scores. The newspaper published its own <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/teachers-investigation/">study and stories</a> last year naming and ranking teachers based on &ldquo;<strong>value-added</strong>&rdquo; measurements.</p>
<p><a href="http://gothamschools.org/2012/10/15/state-releases-agreement-for-data-system-that-raised-concerns/">A parents group in New York City</a> has written a letter to the state&rsquo;s attorney general asking the state to stop its participation in the <strong><a href="http://slcedu.org">Shared Learning Collaborative</a></strong>, a Gates Foundation-funded effort to build a technology infrastructure to facilitate schools&rsquo; handling of student data. The parents are concerned, they say, about student privacy and worry that information will be handed over to third parties, particularly for-profit vendors like News Corp-owned Wireless Generation which is helping develop the project.</p>
<h2>Updates and Upgrades</h2>
<p><a href="http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2012/10/opinion/random-house-says-libraries-own-their-ebooks-lj-insider/#_"><strong>Random House</strong> says that libraries own their e-books</a>. That&rsquo;s the headline of a LibraryJournal article, and it&rsquo;s a pretty big deal considering that many of the other Big 6 Publishers have been acting as though libraries <em>license</em> rather than <em>own</em> e-books when they purchase them.</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Texas</strong> system announced this week that it&rsquo;s <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/u-of-texas-system-is-latest-to-sign-up-with-edx-for-online-courses/40440">joining edX</a>, the non-profit MOOC initiative started by MIT and Harvard. It will begin offering classes on the platform next fall.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://unglue.it">Unglue.it</a></strong>, a crowdfunding site to help &ldquo;unglue&rdquo; e-books and release them freely (DRM-free and openly licensed), has relaunched, having been forced to close down when Amazon <a href="http://blog.unglue.it/2012/08/09/open-thread-amazon-forces-unglue-it-to-suspend-crowdfunding-for-creative-commons-ebooks/">cut off</a> the startup&rsquo;s access to its payment system. Unglue.it will now use the online payment system Stripe and has started campaigns to unglue 5 new books.</p>
<p>Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger has launched his new startup, <strong><a href="http://larrysanger.org/2012/10/reading-bears-first-press-release-please-share/">ReadingBear.org</a></strong>, a free website that teaches reading through phonics.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/01/02/robot-graders-and-other-ed-tech-predictions-for-2012/">predicted</a> that <strong>Amazon</strong> wouldn&rsquo;t make any major moves in education this year, and if you ignore the millions that Bezos has invested into ed-tech startups and into pro-charter schools initiative, I almost got it right &mdash; until this week when the company announced <a href="https://whispercast.amazon.com/">Kindle Whispercast</a>, a new tool that lets schools and libraries better manage their Kindles via the Web. An Amazon subsidiary also launched a couple of kid- and parent-oriented websites, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/amazons-quidsi-targets-kids-with-new-sites-bookworm-com-afterschool-com/">reports Techcrunch</a>: Bookworm.com and Afterschool.com.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> released an update to its <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.ca/2012/10/ngram-viewer-20.html">Ngram Viewer</a> this week, its tool for letting you look at word and phrase-frequencies throughout literary history (or at least throughout the history of materials that Google has digitized as part of its book-scanning efforts). Google has added new materials to the Ngram dataset and also lets you specify the parts of speech you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> unveiled a <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.ca/2012/10/the-new-chromebook-for-every-student.html">new Chromebook model</a> this week that&rsquo;s somewhat akin to the Macbook Air in so far as it&rsquo;s lighter and thinner. The new device costs $249.</p>
<p><strong>2tor</strong>, a company that helps colleges and universities offer online classes, has <a href="http://2u.com/news/education-technology-leader-2tor-changes-name-to-2u/">changed its name</a> to 2U, a smart re-branding I think as 2tor doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;tutor.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Departures and Closures</h2>
<p>Michael Chasen, the co-founder and CEO of <strong>Blackboard</strong>, will step down at the end of the year. Ray Henderson has a nice <a href="http://www.rayhblog.com/blog/2012/10/news-michael-chasen-steps-down.html">retrospective</a> on Chasen&rsquo;s tenure and the history of the company. I like this line: &ldquo;Michael&rsquo;s legacy is to leave us mildly paranoid but battle tested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Phoenix</strong> will be <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/2012/10/16/university-phoenix-closing-locations/dCpGRJUOFJ19FuV56r0i7H/story.html">closing 115 locations</a>, its parent company the Apollo Group announced, following a fall by 60% in its fourth quarter net income. Some 13,000 students will be affected.</p>
<p>Lane Merrifield, the co-founder of the popular kids&rsquo; website <strong>Club Penguin</strong>, is leaving the company (which was sold to Disney in 2007 for $700 million), <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20121017/club-penguin-co-founder-lane-merrifield-signs-off-after-five-years-at-disney/">reports AllThingsD</a>. Merrifield will join <a href="http://www.freshgrade.com/">FreshGrade</a>, an education startup focused on &ldquo;capturing learning&rdquo; according to its website.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson</strong> filed a DMCA notice against a teacher&rsquo;s 2007 blog post (which shared a copy of Beck&rsquo;s Hopelessness Scale &mdash; a list of 20 questions published in 1974), <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121013/18332220701/textbook-publisher-pearson-takes-down-15-million-teacher-student-blogs-with-single-dmca-notice.shtml">reports Techdirt</a>, resulting in Edublogs&rsquo; hosting company ServerBeach yanking the servers for all 1.4 million-plus blogs hosted there. IP is broken.</p>
