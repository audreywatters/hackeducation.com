<p><em>(Another post in my series on <a href="/2012/09/23/what-educators-need-to-know-about-tech/">what educators should know about the business of (ed-)tech</a>.)</em></p>
<p>I confess: before I became a technology journalist, I&rsquo;d never thought twice about the funding process for startups. Sure, I&rsquo;d heard plenty about investors in general &mdash; that Warren Buffett fellow, for example; but I knew nothing about the workings of venture capital &mdash; how technology startups received investment, what that investment meant, who the investors were, and so on. I&rsquo;m guessing that many folks are in the same boat. Hence this post&hellip;</p>
<h2>What is venture capital?</h2>
<p>Unlike other businesses that rely on bank loans in order to fund their growth and expansion, technology startups rely on a different investment model.</p>
<p>At their early stages, many startups opt for &ldquo;seed funding,&rdquo; which as the name suggests gives them the seed to get started and growing. That funding can come from &ldquo;friends and family&rdquo; or, more likely, from angel investors -- wealthy individuals who invest a &ldquo;small&rdquo; amount of initial financial capital. Seed investment is generally under a million dollars.</p>
<p>It has become a lot cheaper in recent years to launch a technology startup, due to cloud computing (low or no infrastructure costs) and free, open source software. But even with those lower initial costs, it often takes technology startups more than that first seed investment to keep growing (or, heck, keep existing, as the case may be).</p>
<p>After raising seed investment, many startups then turn to venture capitalists for their next rounds of funding. Unlike angel investors who invest their own money, venture capitalists manage funds of other people&rsquo;s (and organizations&rsquo;) money. As such, the size of VC investment is often much larger.</p>
<h2>What are the expectations when a startup takes investment?</h2>
<p>When you take out a loan from the bank &mdash; whether for a car or for your business &mdash; the bank <em>will</em> get its money back (under most circumstances, of course). Typically, you pay monthly interest on the money that&rsquo;s lent, and there&rsquo;s a set time period over the course of which you make re-payments.</p>
<p>Venture capital doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Technology startups are seen as high-risk investments &mdash; most startups fail after all and so there's no guarantee that investors will get their money back. Instead of making repayments on the money that they&rsquo;re given as with a bank loan, startups give over an equity stake in their company to investors.</p>
<p>That means that investors&rsquo; return on their investment is based on how big and how profitable the startup eventually becomes. Typically, investors expect a return on their investment in about 3 to 7 years.</p>
<p>That return comes with an &ldquo;exit.&rdquo; Typically that involves an IPO (an &ldquo;initial public offering&rdquo; or becoming a publicly traded company on the stock market) or an acquisition by a larger company.</p>
<h2>Who are some of the prominent investors in education technology?</h2>
<p>Below is by no means a complete list of technology investors who have education companies in their portfolio. Nor is it a list of the &ldquo;top&rdquo; or the &ldquo;best&rdquo; or the &ldquo;most profitable&rdquo; or &ldquo;most active&rdquo; ones, although for what it&rsquo;s worth the list does match closely the <a href="http://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-top-active-VCs-in-the-education-technology-space">answer on Quora</a> to &ldquo;Who are the top (active) VCs in the education technology space?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Who cares?</h2>
<p>Why should educators care about the investment models that technology startups pursue? Hopefully, there are clues above. In a nutshell, investors are drawn to certain kinds of startups, shaping in turns the kinds of companies that get that funding to get to the next level. (It is definitely possible to bootstrap or crowdfund your company, of course, but that remains the exception in technology startup-land.)</p>
<p>Venture capital goes to high-risk, high-growth companies &mdash; that is, investors (often, not always &mdash; depending on their investment priorities) choose the companies that they think have the potential for the biggest growth, biggest return, fastest exit. The next Google, if you will. And that exit is important &mdash; that is the &ldquo;happy ending&rdquo; for investors (and entrepreneurs). That ending might not be so happy for users, particularly if an acquisition results in the tech tool being scrapped by the new corporate owners, but such is the circle of startup life.</p>
<p>The path to that exit isn&rsquo;t always easy or obvious for any technology startup, but education companies haven&rsquo;t had a lot of success pursuing IPOs. Blackboard, for example, went public in 2004, but went private again in 2011 when the company was purchased by an equity firm. K12 is a publicly traded company, but concerns about its academic track record have <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NYSE:LRN">dampened investors&rsquo; interest</a> in the stock.</p>
<p>The more likely exit for ed-tech startups once that investment clock starts ticking is acquisition. But as <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/education-startups-acquisition-2012-4?op=1">Business Insider</a> noted with slight exaggeration this year, there are problems there too. &ldquo;There are a million education startups and no one to acquire them.&rdquo; BI points to Pearson, McGraw-Hill, Apollo Group (owners of the University of Phoenix), Apple, Texas Instruments, Devry, and The Washington Post (a.k.a. Kaplan), News Corp, and Google as possible buyers for the latest crop of new ed-tech startups.</p>
<p>One interesting thing to note with the list of investors above: many of the most prominent venture capital firms do not currently have a deep education portfolio. Indeed, if you visit their websites, you&rsquo;ll find that they have special pages dedicated to other sectors, such as biotech, or information tech, or cleantech, but no mention of the education vertical. I think that&rsquo;s a reflection of how recent their (renewed) interest is in ed-tech as a potentially profitable investment.</p>
<p>The <a href="/2012/10/04/union-square-ventures/">lack of depth and expertise</a> among some of these VCs also means that those firms with more of an education focus are likely to be the leaders in the early rounds of funding, with other investors then following on in later rounds. That gives enormous power and influence to Pearson-backed Learn Capital and to charter-school focused NewSchools Venture Fund in particular in establishing who gets out of the gate with strong, initial seed funding.</p>
