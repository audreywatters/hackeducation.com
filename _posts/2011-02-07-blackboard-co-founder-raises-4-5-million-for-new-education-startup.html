<p><a href="http://www.blackboard.com">Blackboard</a> co-founder Matthew Pittinsky has raised $4.5 million for a new educational startup, according to a <a href="http://secwatch.com/filings/view.jsp?formid=7552437">regulatory filing</a> from the company.  Parchment is still in stealth mode (<a href="http://www.parchment.com">www.parchment.com</a> simply redirects to a generic page), so no word yet on what exactly the startup will do.</p>
<p>One clue, perhaps, comes from the address and names listed on the filing.  The address is the same as <a href="http://www.docufide.com/">Docufide</a>, a service that helps students transfer their transcripts to schools and universities, and several names listed on Parchment's filing are Docufide executives, including CEO John Reese.</p>
