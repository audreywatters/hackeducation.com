<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p><strong>President Obama</strong> took executive action on <strong>immigration reform</strong> this week, offering limited legal status (a temporary reprieve from deportation, that is) to up to five million of the country&rsquo;s 11.4 million undocumented immigrants. <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/150171/">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a> and <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/11/21/what-obama%E2%80%99s-immigration-executive-actions-mean-higher-education">Inside Higher Ed</a> examine the potential impact on higher ed; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/19/pew-kids-of-undocumented-immigrants_n_6187356.html">The Huffington Post</a> has a look at the impact at the K&ndash;12 level.</p>
<p><strong>The White House</strong> also hosted superintendents this week to sign a &ldquo;<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/11/white_house_summit_unveils_ed_tech_resources_for_K-12_%20schools.html">Future Ready</a>&rdquo; pledge, promising to buy more digital stuff from textbook publishers and tech companies and telecoms. Because future.</p>
<p><strong>FCC</strong> Chairman Tom Wheeler has <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/11/17/fcc-proposes-3.9-billion-for-school-technology-program.aspx">proposed</a> a major financial boost to the <strong>E-rate program</strong>, increasing its cap by $1.5 billion. That&rsquo;ll bring the total earmarked for the fund, which helps support and subsidize public schools&rsquo; and libraries&rsquo; network and telecom costs, to $3.9 million.</p>
<p>The <strong>FTC</strong> has reached a $200,000 <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/17/privacy-certifier-for-web-business-truste-settles-with-ftc-for-200k/">settlement</a> with <strong>TRUSTe </strong>over deceptive labels and promises. The company purports to certify that companies handle data safely. But nope. So yeah. Just because that ed-tech company proudly displays a TRUSTe seal doesn&rsquo;t mean your data is safe; it means that they paid for the seal.</p>
<p><strong>Senator Tom Harkin</strong> is set to retire in a few weeks. But he&rsquo;s just released his proposal to revise the <strong>Higher Education Act</strong>. <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/11/21/departing-senator-harkin-releases-his-higher-ed-act-reauthorization-bill">Inside Higher Ed</a> has more on the legislation, which will likely go nowhere. Because Congress.</p>
<p>Certain-to-be-a-Republican-Presidential-candidate <strong>Jeb Bush</strong> made comments about education this week as he delivered the keynote at his education group&rsquo;s <a href="http://bit.ly/1zDYtjJ">2014 National Summit on Education Reform</a>.</p>
<p>The Department of Education and the <strong>Minneapolis Public School District</strong> have <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-education-department-reaches-voluntary-resolution-agreement-following-minneap">reached an agreement</a> after an investigation which &ldquo;revealed that <strong>black students</strong> in grades K&ndash;12 were significantly overrepresented in the district&rsquo;s disciplinary actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worried about facing national ridicule if a <strong>Satanic group</strong> is allowed to give out <strong>coloring books to children</strong>, the <strong>Orange County School Board</strong> moved Thursday toward preventing any outside group from distributing religious materials on campus.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/os-satanic-pamphlets-board-reacts-20141113-story.html">Ha</a>. Since when is <strong>Florida</strong> concerned about facing national ridicule?!</p>
<p><strong>LAUSD</strong>&rsquo;s board has <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/lausd-board-votes-to-add-ethnic-studies-to-schools-curriculum/">voted</a> to add <strong>ethnic studies</strong> to the district curriculum. It&rsquo;s part of a larger effort to make ethnic studies a required class for graduation.</p>
<p><strong>LAUSD</strong> has <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/11/13/48034/lausd-argued-middle-schooler-can-consent-to-sex-wi/">argued</a> that a middle schooler can <strong>consent</strong> to sex with a teacher. The case involves a 14 year old student and her 28 year old teacher. The district, which is being sued by the girl&rsquo;s family for negligence, says that the girl bears some responsibility. Wow. Fuck you, LAUSD.</p>
<p>Colleges and universities have received most of the scrutiny about how they&rsquo;ve mishandled <strong>sexual assault cases</strong>. But the Department of Education is also <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/18/school-districts-sexual-assault_n_6154386.html">investigating</a> 24 elementary and secondary schools of violating <strong>Title IX</strong> by mishandling these sorts of incidents.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/barbie_ed_tech.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>LAUSD and the Zombie iPad Contract</h2>
<p>Back from the dead! <strong>LAUSD</strong> has <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2014/11/19/17583/ipad-contract-resurected-lausd-to-spend-22-million/">not canceled</a> all its contract with <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Pearson</strong> apparently, and the district will spend $22 million to buy 20,000 iPads just in time for spring <strong>standardized testing</strong> season. But this time around, instead of spending $504 per device, the district will pay $552 per iPad. Niiiiiiiiiiice.</p>
<h2>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h2>
<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/11/14/hack-education-weekly-news-11-14-2014/">Last week</a> <strong>Coursera</strong> announced free verified certificates for <strong>veterans</strong>; <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/103050170952/president-obama-supports-free-two-year-coursera">this week</a>, it&rsquo;s free verified certificates for <strong>teachers</strong>. <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-11-19-free-coursera-pd-thanks-to-the-president">Thanks Obama</a>, for taking such a strong stance against <strong>for-profit higher ed</strong>.</p>
<p>Not to miss out on the PR opportunity, <strong>edX</strong> is <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/11/20/edx-launching-moocs-with-free-certificates-for-teacher-training-and-ap-prep.aspx">also offering</a> free certificates for teacher training.</p>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> is <a href="https://tech.coursera.org/blog/2014/11/19/bringing-data-to-teaching/">bringing data to teaching</a>. Because <strong>data dashboards</strong> &ldquo;help instructors understand their learners and make informed decisions.&rdquo; Education has, up until now, never had a way for instructors to understand learners, I guess.</p>

<h2>Elsewhere in &ldquo;Openness&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Creative Commons</strong> has released its <a href="https://stateof.creativecommons.org/report/">State of the Commons report</a>. &ldquo;Sharing is winning. In 2015, we&rsquo;ll pass one billion Creative Commons&ndash;licensed works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>K&ndash;12 OER Collaborative</strong>, supported by 11 states, has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-11-19-11-states-ban-together-to-release-mega-oer-rfp-worth-15-20m">released</a> an RFP seeking <strong>OER</strong> materials to cover math and language arts at the K&ndash;12 level. As districts are poised to spend some $8 billion to buy new CCSS-aligned textbooks, the hope is to offer an alternative that not just saves money but that can be localized, shared, and remixed.</p>
<p><strong>The Gates Foundation</strong> has <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/General-Information/Open-Access-Policy">adopted</a> an <strong>open access</strong> policy &ldquo;that enables the unrestricted access and reuse of all peer-reviewed published research funded, in whole or in part, by the foundation, including any underlying data sets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, <strong>open education</strong> has <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/open-educations-publicity-problem/55191">a publicity problem</a>.</p>

<p>Parents have been sent home &ldquo;what to do in case of an emergency&rdquo; notes. But in the <strong>St. Louis</strong> area, the fear-mongering isn&rsquo;t about bad weather. It&rsquo;s about the results of the grand jury investigation of Darren Wilson, the police officer who killed the teenaged <strong>Michael Brown</strong> this summer. St. Louis schools will apparently get a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/14/st-louis-schools-will-get-advanced-notice-of-grand-jury-decision/19034431/">3 hour advanced notice</a> of the decision.</p>
<p>Three people were <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/11/20/update-3-shot-florida-state-u-library-book-blocks-bullet">shot</a> at the <strong>Florida State University Library</strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an assistant principal in Polk County, <strong>Florida</strong> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/11/20/principal-suspended-after-armed-officers-conduct-live-shooter-drill-during-school/">staged</a> a <strong>live shooter drill</strong> in which police went classroom to classroom with their guns drawn. &ldquo;&hellip;The school resource officer involved in the drill was carrying a loaded Glock .45-caliber pistol, while a patrol officer was holding an AR&ndash;15 rifle, though it was not loaded. Some students became terrified and ducked for cover.&rdquo; Terrified?! Are you serious?!</p>
<p>An elementary school in <strong>Los Alamitos</strong> will let parents <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/homework-641956-school-program.html">pay $100</a> to buy their kids a week free of <strong>homework</strong>. Because the public school system in America is sooooo damn equitable.</p>
<p><strong>University of Maryland University College</strong> will stay a public university, <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/150109/">says its president</a>.</p>
<p>Some 43 students in a &ldquo;Sports, Ethics, and Religion&rdquo; class at <strong>Yale</strong> have been <a href="http://thedartmouth.com/2014/11/12/news/dozens-of-students-linked-to-cheating-in-religion-class">accused</a> of academic dishonesty. Apparently, they cheated with clickers. In an ethics class.</p>
<p>The <strong>University of California Board of Regents</strong> has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/11/21/u-california-board-votes-hike-tuition-27-2020">voted</a> to raise tuition by up to 27% by 2020. Governor Jerry Brown and pretty much every public school student (and their parents?) oppose the hike.</p>

<p>Not to let <strong>LAUSD</strong>&rsquo;s student information system get all the laughs, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/city-schools-dumping-95-million-computer-system-article-1.2012454">New York City says </a>it&rsquo;s dumping the system it spent $95 million on. <strong>Joel Klein</strong>, now touting how great his ed reform efforts were in his new book, oversaw the development of the <strong>ARIS system</strong>.

<p>Incidentally, <strong>NYC</strong> schools aren&rsquo;t buying <strong>Amplify</strong> tablets either. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/17/chromebooks-get-blanket-approval-for-nyc-schools/">They&rsquo;re going with <strong>Google Chromebooks</strong></a>.</p>

<p>A <strong>Florida State University</strong> football player, P. J.

He fled the scene. &ldquo;Mr. Williams, driving with a suspended license, had been given a break by the Tallahassee police, who initially labeled the accident a hit and run, a criminal act, but later decided to issue Mr. Williams only two traffic tickets. Afterward, the case did not show up in the city&rsquo;s public online database of police calls &mdash; a technical error, the police said.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p>Some folks were excited when <strong>Mattel</strong> said it was going to make a computer engineer <strong>Barbie</strong>. And why wouldn&rsquo;t they be. The doll has such a great track record of strong messages for smart girls. Messages like &ldquo;Math is hard. Let&rsquo;;s go shopping.&rdquo; This week, Barbie came out with a new book, <em>I Can Be A Computer Engineer</em>, published by Random House (owned by <strong>Pearson</strong>). I&rsquo;d say <a href="http://gizmodo.com/barbie-f-cks-it-up-again-1660326671">OMG DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK</a>, but apparently Mattel has already pulled it from store shelves. See, Barbie has a pink computer. She can&rsquo;t program. She breaks things. She recruits two guys to help her write the code because she only good at &ldquo;creating design ideas.&rdquo; She infects Skipper&rsquo;s computer with a virus, who then gets so mad &ndash; I mean, she&rsquo;s lost her homework because she didn&rsquo;t create a backup! &ndash; that she gets into a pillow fight with Barbie.</p>

<p><strong>Pearson</strong>&rsquo;s &ldquo;charitable wing,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pearsonfoundation.org/">the <strong>Pearson Foundation</strong></a>, will be closing its doors at the end of the year. The organization has come under intense scrutiny for how much of a division really exists between it and its parent company. <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2013/12/pearson_foundation_to_pay_77_million_to_Settle_NY_Claim_of_Misusing_Funds.html">Last year</a>, the organization paid an almost $8 million settlement to the state of New York over accusations that its actions were really funneling money to the for-profit Pearson. Shocking, I know. The <strong>Gates Foundation</strong> recently gave the foundation $3 million to develop curricula for the <strong>Common Core</strong>. I&rsquo;m curious what&rsquo;ll happen to the projects that the foundation supported. And, of course, the content and the student data.</p>
