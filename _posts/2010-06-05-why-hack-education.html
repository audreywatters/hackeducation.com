<p>When I list nouns to describe who I am, I typically include the following: writer, geek, former academic. Those three coalesce around my interest in educational technology.</p>
<p>I try to write about edtech as often as I can (with some of my writing gigs that is, indeed, my assignment). But it's a topic that I believe receives far too little attention from technology journalists, and when it does, it's often from an angle that doesn't really account for the practical experiences of teachers and students in the classroom.</p>
<p>So that's what I'm going to try to write about here.</p>
<p>The title of this blog - Hack Education - has a dual meaning. I'd like to see technologies disrupt some of the traditional ways in which teaching and learning happen. But the addition of technology isn't just magically "disruptive."</p>
<p>I would like to see educators have a larger voice in shaping the development of technology, too. I do wonder if we need to steer away from a separate (and often ghettoized) category of edtech and instead make sure that the technologies we design are all, in fact, learning tools.</p>
