<p><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OpenCourseWare</a> and <a href="http://openstudy.com/">OpenStudy</a> have teamed up to provide interactive study groups about a dozen MIT OCW classes, giving learners an opportunity to discuss and collaborate with others moving through the same course material.  The pilot program has been phenomenally successful.  Read more at <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/openstudy_teams_up_with_mit_opencourseware_to_help.php">RWW</a>.</p>
<p>And speaking of open education, NYU does just that, launching an <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/academics/open-education/pilot-project.html">Open Education Pilot</a> program at the school.  The program will offer two courses:  American Literature until the Civil War, taught by professor Cyrus Patell, and New York City: a Social History, taught by professor Daniel Walkowitz.</p>
<p>As part of its digital citizenship initiative, PBS KIDS provides a number of resources for kids and parents, including a new game called <a href="http://pbskids.org/webonauts/">Webonauts Internet Academy</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.campuscomputing.net/2010-campus-computing-survey">2010 Campus Computing Survey</a> is out.  No surprise:  there have been substantial IT budget cuts at both public and private universities.  More interesting:  <a href="http://www.blackboard.com">Blackboard</a>'s share of the LMS market is down significantly, from 71% to 57%.  Its competitors -- <a href="http://sakaiproject.org/">Sakai</a>, <a href="http://www.moodle.org">Moodle</a>, and <a href="http://www.desire2learn.com">Desire2Learn</a> -- all saw their market share increase.</p>
<p>eBook makers -- and yes, that could mean you -- <a href="http://bookbrewer.com/home">BookBrewer</a> has launched its service that allows you to self-publish your eBook.  There are a lot of self-publishing alternatives out there, but I am particularly intrigued by BookBrewer's ability to turn an RSS feed into an eBook, as well as the option to get a DRM-free ePub version of your content.
