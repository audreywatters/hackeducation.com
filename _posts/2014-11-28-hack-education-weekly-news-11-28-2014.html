<p>In previous years, the week of <strong>Thanksgiving</strong> often means that I write something like &ldquo;not a lot of news out of the US&rdquo; as folks focus on turkey, football, and shopping. Not this year. Not this week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been just over 100 days since police officer <strong>Darren Wilson</strong> shot and killed 18-year-old <strong>Michael Brown</strong>. Brown was walking to his grandmother&rsquo;s house in <strong>Ferguson</strong>, Missouri. He was unarmed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been just over 100 days since protests erupted in <strong>Ferguson</strong> in response. It&rsquo;s been just over 100 days since the story was featured in an <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/08/22/hack-education-weekly-news-8-22-2014/">earlier Hack Education Weekly News</a> or EML &ldquo;<a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-35/">What You Should Know This Week</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What you should know this week is something that probably most people expected: that a <strong>grand jury</strong> has declined to indict Wilson for Brown&rsquo;s death. Prosecutor Bob McCulloch <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/us/ferguson-darren-wilson-shooting-michael-brown-grand-jury.html%20">announced</a> the decision at 9pm Eastern on Monday night. Interesting timing.</p>
<p>In his statement, McCulloch spent a good deal of time condemning <strong>social media</strong> for spreading questionable and <a href="http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/26/7295595/eyewitnesses-ferguson-grand-jury">inaccurate information</a> about the shooting. He read the state&rsquo;s timeline of events, and then pronounced that Wilson would not face criminal charges. In <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7295641/darren-wilson-prosecute">an unusual move</a> (grand juries are usually short and usually secret), he then released much of the testimony and evidence to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Ferguson</strong> had been bracing for this (and frankly, probably expecting that this would be the outcome of the grand jury). Stores had boarded up their windows; schools were closed. <strong>Missouri</strong> Governor Jay Nixon had already declared a state of emergency, and there were <strong>National Guard</strong> along with police officers patrolling the streets.</p>
<p>Yet once again, as in August, Ferguson found itself in flames. Buildings burned. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/26/us-usa-missouri-shooting-idUSKCN0J80PR20141126">Arrests were made</a>. There have been protests all over the United States (and elsewhere too) about the decision.</p>
<p>Some schools in the <strong>St. Louis</strong> area remain closed (it is the Thanksgiving holiday after all). <a href="http://www.ferguson.lib.mo.us/">The <strong>Ferguson Public Library</strong> has remained open</a>.</p>
<p>This affects <em>all</em> schools &ndash; whether they handle this well <a href="http://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/11/26/controversial-ferguson-protest-poster-removed-from-elementary-school-in-charlestown/">or not</a>. And as students and teachers walk back into classrooms everywhere &mdash; on the heels of McCulloch&rsquo;s announcement, President Obama&rsquo;s call for &ldquo;calm,&rdquo; fiery protests in Ferguson, and news of yet another young black boy killed by police (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-30220700"><strong>Tamir Rice</strong> age 12</a>) &mdash; it is clear that we have to make a space at school where we can listen and learn and grieve in a safe and supportive learning environment. And it&rsquo;s clear too, oh my god it&rsquo;s clear, schools need to do a lot better there.</p>
<p>Back in August, Science Leadership Academy principal Chris Lehmann asked &ldquo;<a href="http://practicaltheory.org/blog/2014/08/13/what-do-we-teach-when-kids-are-dying-michaelbrown/%20">What Do We Teach When Kids Are Dying?</a>&rdquo; I think I quoted him then; and I&rsquo;ll quote him again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So what do we do as educators? What is our role? For to pretend that this does not enter our classrooms, our schools, is to run the risk of allowing ourselves to be complicit in the system that left <strong>Mike Brown</strong>&rsquo;s body in the street for hours. How we teach, how we frame this issue with students is incredibly difficult and complex, and so many of the <a href="http://practicaltheory.org/blog/2014/02/17/teaching-about-the-jordan-davis-murder/">resources, ideas and suggestions created after <strong>Jordan Davis</strong>&rsquo; killer was not convicted of murder</a> are appropriate again. It is incredibly daunting to think about how we frame this issue in our classrooms, but that cannot be the reason for educators to shy away from it. And, if nothing else, now is a moment where educators need to listen deeply to students who need to express what they are feeling.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Education</strong> announced a plan to &ldquo;strengthen teacher preparation.&rdquo; The new guidelines, <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/150263/">writes The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, &ldquo;would require states to evaluate <strong>teacher-training programs</strong> based, in part, on how many of their graduates get and keep jobs and how much their graduates&rsquo; future students learn. Only programs deemed effective by their states would be eligible to award Teach Grants, which provide students with up to $4,000 a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>LAUSD</strong> has <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/miramonte-settlement-is-largest-ever-involving-lausd/">reached</a> a settlement worth almost $140 million with the 81 victims in the the <strong>sex abuse scandal</strong> involving former teacher Mark Berndt at Miramonte Elementary School.</p>
<p><strong>Texas</strong> has <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/11/21/365686593/texas-hits-the-books">approved</a> new social studies curriculum. Among its glorious contributions to the intellectual development of young people, it lists the four people who influenced the Founding Fathers as William Blackstone, John Locke, and Charles de Montesquieu, and <strong>Moses</strong>. Better add a new face to Mount Rushmore for that last one, man.</p>
<p>Students in <strong>Finland</strong> will <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-30146160">no longer</a> learn handwriting, but will learn typing skills instead. I look forward to the responses from those who hail Finland as the model for all education reforms .</p>
<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/1114/morningeducation16221.html">Via Politico</a>: &ldquo;The blockbuster contract <strong>Pearson</strong> signed earlier this year to deliver the new <strong>PARCC Common Core exams</strong> based its pricing on a minimum of 5.5 million students nationwide taking the tests next spring. But several states dropped out, leaving just under 5 million students to take the exams. (Another 325,000 children in Louisiana will take a modified test that uses PARCC questions but is delivered by another vendor.) At that volume, Pearson will earn a minimum of $138 million in the first year of the contract. But because the contract was crafted in anticipation of a higher revenue flow to Pearson, PARCC member states have agreed to scale back the amount of work the company must do on the exams.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Norway</strong> has decided <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/11/24/norway-scraps-plans-charge-non-eu-students-tuition">not to charge</a> non-EU residents college tuition.</p>
<p>Judge Denise Cote has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/technology/judge-approves-450-million-settlement-in-apple-e-book-case.html">approved</a> a settlement in which <strong>Apple</strong> will pay some $400 million to some 23 million consumers over charges that it violated <strong>antitrust law</strong> by conspiring with publishers to raise e-book prices.</p>
<h2>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h2>
<p><strong>JetBlue</strong> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/11/24/how-is-jetblue-planning-to-improve-its-profitability/">announced</a> a number of measures to improve its profitability this week: charging for checked bags, for example. But hey! Look! It&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/103477375027/learn-from-coursera-on-your-next-jetblue-flight">partnered</a> with <strong>Coursera</strong> to offer MOOCs as part of the &ldquo;in-flight entertainment&rdquo; system. Sounds like the future of ed-tech to me!</p>
<h2>Meanwhile on Campus</h2>
<p>A bit of a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/11/25/22-year-old-wins-approval-to-open-n-y-charter-school-but-his-credentials-now-questioned/">kerfuffle</a> this week involving 22-year-old Ted Morris who was granted a charter to open a school in <strong>Rochester</strong>, New York. After <a href="http://curmudgucation.blogspot.com/2014/11/more-on-rochester-charter-wunderkind-or.html">media</a> <a href="http://deutsch29.wordpress.com/2014/11/25/what-do-we-really-know-about-ted-j-morris-jr-an-update/">scrutiny</a> that revealed Morris exaggerated his credentials, he <a href="http://dianeravitch.net/2014/11/25/22-year-old-leader-resigns-charter-post-in-new-york/">resigned</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confused. I thought that the <strong>LAUSD</strong> contract with <strong>Apple</strong> had been cancelled. Apparently not? &ldquo;We just made the determination not to place an order against that contract,&rdquo; <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/for-lausd-more-chromebooks-ipads-means-more-confusion/">says</a> facilities director Mark Hovatter. Oh. Um. Okay. <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/cortines-approves-next-phase-of-lausd-ipad-program/">Onward</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to <strong>Kean University</strong> for its recent <a href="http://gawker.com/college-buys-219-000-table-1663243389">purchase</a> of a $219,000 conference table.</p>

<p>A school in Los Alamitos, California will <a href="http://abc7.com/education/los-alamitos-school-retracts-homework-buyout-fundraiser/393463/">no longer run</a> a fundraiser in which parents could pay $100 to opt their children out of <strong>homework</strong>. Nice work, Internet. You helped dismantle this unequitable crap.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-cal-state-transfers-20141126-story.html">Via The LA Times</a>: &ldquo;Rather than increasing tuition, <strong>Cal State</strong> has reduced enrollment targets for this fall. And trustees recently discussed the dark scenario of having to stop accepting freshmen.&rdquo; Meanwhile, students are <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/11/24/366370724/california-college-students-walk-out-of-class-to-protest-tuition-hikes">protesting</a> proposed tuition hikes for public universities in the state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Students in <strong>University of California at Berkeley</strong>&rsquo;s Graduate Journalism Program will pay an additional $7,500 in tuition per year, after the Board of Regent&rsquo;s approved a supplemental fee this week,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/11/25/berkeley-j-school-fee-approved">reports Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p>Students at <strong>Emory University</strong> are in violation of the honor code for <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/150207/">selling seats</a> in popular courses.</p>
<p>Good thing we&rsquo;re really cracking down on this whole &ldquo;<strong>honor code</strong>&rdquo; thing, right? Right? No really. Guys. Do not make me create a &ldquo;<strong>Rape</strong>&rdquo; section for the weekly education news, okay?</p>
<p>Responding to the recent <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/11/22/365970415/uva-bans-fraternities-until-january-in-wake-of-campus-rape-article">Rolling Stone article</a> on a brutal rape at a <strong>UVA</strong> fraternity, the school has <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/11/22/365970415/uva-bans-fraternities-until-january-in-wake-of-campus-rape-article">banned all school fraternities</a> until January 9. (Is school even in session now?! It's the holidays.) The university has <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7294789/uva-sexual-assault-rape">expelled</a> 183 for honor code violations in the last decade, but has expelled no one over sexual assault, even though the perpetrators in the Rolling Stone story are known.

Students have been protesting how the school responded to the incidents, particularly as the victims have been the targets of bullying by the assailant&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <strong>University of Massachusetts at Amherst</strong>, where <strong>Bill Cosby</strong> was awarded a doctorate more than 35 years ago, has asked him to resign as an honorary co-chair of the school&rsquo;s capital campaign,&rdquo; reports <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/11/27/bill-cosbys-alma-mater-cuts-ties-with-besieged-entertainer/">The Washington Post</a>.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I am shocked SHOCKED to learn that &ldquo;<strong>personalized instruction</strong>&rdquo; is overhyped. A <a href="http://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/personalized-instruction">study</a> released this week by Noel Enyedy, an associate professor of education and information studies at UCLA, says that computer-mediated learning produces uneven results (or, ya know, zero results), often at great expense to school districts. Oh well! Carry on, ed-tech!</p>
