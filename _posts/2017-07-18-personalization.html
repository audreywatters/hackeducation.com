<p>In early June, I gave a keynote at the OEB MidSummit on <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/06/09/personalization">the history of &quot;personalization</a>.&#8220; I only had 20 minutes, so it&#8217;s a partial history at best. But as &#8221;personalized learning&quot; has become one of the most prominent buzzwords in education technology, I think it&#8217;s worth investigating its origins and its trajectory at length.</p>

<p>Personalized learning is often tied to the progressive educators of the early twentieth century &#8211; to John Dewey and Maria Montessori, for example &#8211; even though much of the educational software that&#8217;s marketed by Silicon Valley and education reformers as &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; has <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/07/08/what-went-wrong">very little to do with progressive educational theory</a>, except perhaps at the most superficial level. Sure, there&#8217;s an invocation of &#8220;choice&#8221; and &#8220;moving-at-your-own-pace,&#8221; but the progenitor for much of today&#8217;s &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; seems to be <em>ad-tech</em> rather than ed-tech. </p>

<p>As part of my Spencer Fellowship, I&#8217;m <a href="http://network.hackeducation.com/">investigating the networks of investors and entrepreneurs who are shaping education technology policies and products</a>, and I&#8217;ve decided to focus on how &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; has come to dominate the narratives surrounding technology-based education reform. </p>

<p>There are two obvious sources of funding and PR for &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; &#8211; the Gates Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The former has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; products and projects; the latter promises it will spend billions. </p>

<p>The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative does not list on its website where its money goes. (It&#8217;s a for-profit company, not a charitable foundation so it does not fall under the same reporting requirements as the Gates Foundation does.) As such, it&#8217;s going to take me some work to piece together exactly what CZI is funding. (Organizations we know have received CZI money: <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2017/05/chan_zuckerberg_initiative_chiefs_for_change_personalized_learning.html">Chiefs for Change</a>, <a href="https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2017/provide-personalized-pathways-to-college-success">the College Board</a>, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-07-11-lost-in-the-cracks-alabama-district-brings-personalized-learning-to-incarcerated-youth">Edsurge (to promote personalized learning projects</a>, and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-invests-byju-indian-education-startup-2016-9">tutoring company BYJU&#8217;s</a>, for starters.) </p>

<p>The Gates Foundation&#8217;s investments in &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; are much easier to track. And to that end I have a couple of projects of my own to unveil:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://history.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html"><strong>The History of the Gates Foundation</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html"><strong>Gates Foundation (Education) Grants</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The amount of money that the Gates Foundation has awarded in education grants is simply staggering: some <strong>$15 billion</strong> across some <strong>3000+ grants</strong> since the organization was founded in 1998.</p>

<p>The Gates Foundation first started funding grants &#8220;to support personalized learning environments where all students achieve&#8221; in 2000, and it has backed the development, adoption, and marketing of &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; every year since then. (It&#8217;s not clear when a school gets a grant for &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; what software it purchases &#8211; is that software also funded by the Gates Foundation? I am assuming here that &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; necessarily means buying software.)</p>

<p>With billions of dollars spent on shaping policies and narratives, the Gates Foundation remains one of the most influential (and anti-democratic) forces in education. As such, it gets to define what &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; is &#8211; what it looks like.</p>

<p>(Still want to insist that &#8220;personalized learning&#8221; is progressive? Never forget: Bill Gates once called constructionism, progressive educator Seymour Papert&#8217;s theory of learning, &#8220;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/07/ff_khan/">bullshit</a>.&#8221; Or at least, I&#8217;ll never forget&#8230;)</p>
