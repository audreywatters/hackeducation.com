<p>Crowdsourced translation site <a href="http://blog.universalsubtitles.org/2011/06/23/khan-academy-integrates-with-universal-subtitles/"><strong>Universal Subtitles</strong></a> announced this week that <a href="http://khanacademy.org"><strong>Khan Academy</strong></a> had fully integrated its translation services with its videos, meaning that viewers can help translate the content into other languages.  (I was under the impression that the $2 million from <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/09/26/googles-project-10100-funds-big-educational-ideas/">Google's 10^100</a> award was going to pay for translation of the videos, but I guess I was mistaken.)</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> has upped the storage amount for <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/06/bigger-mail-on-campus.html">Google Apps for Education</a> mailboxes to 25 GB.  That's a lot of multimedia homework assignments.  Thanks, Google!</p>
<p>Awesome news for those who are sick of having to shell out a hundred bucks for graphing calculators.  The ed-tech startup <a href="http://desmos.com"><strong>Desmos</strong></a> has launched a free, web-based graphing calculator.  Take that, Texas Instruments!  I had the exclusive on the story at <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/06/free-web-based-tools-versus-goliath/">MindShift</a>.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, fans of the kid-friendly virtual world <a href="http://clubpenguin.com"><strong>Club Penguin</strong></a> feared the site had been hacked or closed.  But it turned out <strong>Disney</strong> had just forgotten to renew the domain name.  Oops.</p>
<p>Author <strong>J. K. Rowling</strong> revealed her new site, <a href="http://www.pottermore.com">Pottermore</a>, this week.  Coming this fall, the site will be the digital bookstore for all the <strong>Harry Potter</strong> series, with new, interactive content as well.  Rowling retained all the rights to the digital copies of her books, and she is self-e-publishing them here, bypassing the other major e-booksellers like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.  Notably, the books will be available DRM-free, which is fabulous news as DRM doesn't prevent piracy, no matter what industry folks like to tell you.</p>
<p>The wonderful folks at the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media</a> at George Mason University have launched <a href="http://pressforward.org/"><strong>PressForward</strong></a>, an effort to help reshape scholarly publishing by providing a space where online scholarship can be collected and shared.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/"><strong>University of California</strong></a> libraries have released the results of an e-book survey they launched in October 2010.  Among <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/services/uxdesign/docs/2011/academic_ebook_usage_survey.pdf">its findings</a>:  49% prefer print books for their academic work, while 34% prefer e-books.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court in Pennsylvania <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20110620/us_time/08599207863600">ruled</a> that students have the right to mock their teachers and administrators on Facebook and other social media sites.  The court said that schools were wrong to suspend students for these sorts of actions and that students' speech is protected under the <strong>First Amendment</strong>.</p>
<p>Foreign language learning company <a href="http://busuu.com"><strong>busuu.com</strong></a> has launched an iPad app for travellers.  The free app will help learners with their Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Polish and English.</p>
<p><strong>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</strong> has launched a <a href="https://ideas.hmh.spigit.com/Page/CustomHome">Global Education Challenge</a> to find creative ideas for tools to help students' educational outcomes.  $250,000 in prizes are available, but the deadline is fast approaching:  July 15.</p>
<p>The <strong>Community College Consortium for Open Educational Resources</strong> (CCCOER) has joined the <strong>OpenCourseWare Consortium</strong> (OCW), meaning that students at the 200 schools that are part of CCCOER will now have better access to the open textbook and opencourseware resources of the OCW.</p>
<p>Textbook rental company <a href="http://www.chegg.com"><strong>Chegg</strong></a> has acquired the study-guide company <a href="http://notehall.com"><strong>Notehall</strong></a>.  This is the third acquisition for Chegg, which acquired CourseRank and Cramster last year as part of its plans to offer a more comprehensive suite of e-commerce and administrative tools for students.</p>
<p>The <strong>American Library Association</strong>, which is currently holding its annual meeting, reports that two-thirds of libraries in the U.S. now offer e-books.

<p>And speaking of annual meetings, I'm off to <a href="http://www.isteconference.org">ISTE 2011</a> next week in Philadelphia.  I will be reporting on some of the latest innovations in education technology and on how teachers are integrating technology into their classrooms.  Hope to see many of you there!</p>
