<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/degreed.png" alt="" align="right" /><a href="http://degreed.com/">Degreed</a>, a startup that promises to &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/05/jailbreaking-the-degree/">jailbreak the transcript</a>&rdquo; launched into beta this week. Degreed asks users about their formal and informal education &mdash; what college did you attend, what major did you pursue, what badges have you earned &mdash; and calculates an equivalency score of sorts for certain subject areas. That means that even if you never completed your bachelor&rsquo;s or associate&rsquo;s degree, Degreed will vouch for both your credit hours (ish) and your mastery skills (ish).</p>
<p>I write &ldquo;ish&rdquo; because Degreed isn&rsquo;t fully baked yet. It&rsquo;s in beta after all. And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of reason to be excited about this startup, even if all the pieces aren&rsquo;t yet in place.</p>
<p>Degreed&rsquo;s founding team is a strong one, with a lot of experience in education and entrepreneurship. CEO David Blake worked for Zinch, an education startup&nbsp;<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110915/chegg-buys-zinch-in-another-move-toward-a-social-education-platform/">acquired by Chegg</a>&nbsp;last year, and BYU education professor, and open education evangelist David Wiley sits on the startup&rsquo;s board.</p>
<p>But more importantly to the &ldquo;who&rdquo; of Degreed is the &ldquo;what.&rdquo; The startup is addressing a particularly important issue at a particularly important time: the cost of obtaining a college degree is skyrocketing just as having a college degree become more important. And even though the Internet has helped enable an explosion of learning opportunities, higher education retains a monopoly over accreditation. More precisely even, it&rsquo;s not the credits that matter; it&rsquo;s the degree awarded.</p>
<p>Degreed wants to offer a different way to get &ldquo;credit&rdquo; for what you&rsquo;ve learned. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s there yet. (I'm not sure <em>we're</em> there yet -- institutions, employers, and the like.)</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, I&rsquo;m a good candidate for just this sort of effort. I attended a prestigious university for a couple of years, but then dropped out, got pregnant, and through a variety of then distance-learning, correspondence, and extension classes, pieced together a four-year degree. To make things more complicated, I have a master&rsquo;s degree in an obscure field. I am a PhD dropout (ABD for life, man). And I worked in a field unrelated to any of these disciplines.</p>
<p>Of course, I recognize that might make me an edge case in terms of college graduates &mdash; and you might not want to build a system around those of us who have cobbled together credits for a degree. And yet if you want to serve a population for whom the current diploma-oriented system doesn&rsquo;t work, here we are... I recognize too&nbsp;that I don't have a commonly-awarded degree from a well-known university. When you list your schools and your major, Degreed automatically populates a transcript for you and gives you points based on the classes that it&rsquo;s assumed you&rsquo;ve taken. (And it&rsquo;s easy enough to rough that out based on course catalogs and graduation requirements.) But for my undergraduate and graduate and even Coursera-related studies, I couldn&rsquo;t find the right degrees or classes on Degreed's rather standardized list of majors and classes.</p>
<p>Somewhere, buried in a file folder somewhere in my apartment, I do have copies (unofficial) of all my transcripts. And I could go through and adjust my Degreed records so as to recalibrate a better score for me.&nbsp;But that&rsquo;s a lot of data entry.</p>

<p>More troubling for me is whether or not I should really get &ldquo;mastery points&rdquo; for any of the courses I took back in 1990. Heck, even the 228 points I was awarded for mastery in Comp Lit (my doctoral field), feel a little weird. Yes, I have a BS. But is &ldquo;mastery&rdquo; how I&rsquo;d frame it? (I say this, of course, recognizing that despite their gradations, &ldquo;mastery&rdquo; could be closely aligned with &ldquo;competency&rdquo; &mdash; a new model for awarding credits used by Western Governors University, as well as New Charter University, a for-profit for which Degreed founder Blake has worked.)</p>
<p>And what do I&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;with these mastery points? (228 mastery points in Comp Lit and $1.75 will buy me a coffee at Starbucks.) Is this a metric that employers are interested in? Can mastery points compete with degrees?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the answers to all these questions are just Degreed&rsquo;s to answer. As the startup moves through its beta process &mdash; particularly alongside all the Coursera, Udacity, and Skillshare classes and the Khan Academy and Codecademy badges &mdash; it will be interesting to see whether this startup can help do what it promises: help learners to jailbreak the transcript, wrest accreditation out of the hands of institutions and into their own, where the interface and data is more open and more hackable.</p>
