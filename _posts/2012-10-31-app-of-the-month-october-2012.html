<p><em>In <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/05/31/best-new-educational-apps-may-2012/">May</a>, I decided to re-institute a new monthly feature here, something that I used to write for <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/">MindShift</a>: a post highlighting some of the new and updated educational apps that have been released over the past 30 days or so. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s worth continuing, frankly, as each month that goes by, I seem to choose fewer and fewer apps to feature. Clearly this isn&rsquo;t an exhaustive list of all the new educational apps. Clearly. It&rsquo;s just the one that I thought was the most exciting.</em></p>
<h2>Go Go Games</h2>

<p><a href="http://go-go-games.com/">Go Go Games</a> was among my favorites when I first saw Stanford grad students and startup founders Joy Wong Daniels, Alexis Hiniker, and Heidi Williamson demo it at the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/08/03/ldt-expo-2012-storified/">LDT Expo back in August</a>. The iPad app made its official debut in the iTunes Store this month, and so let me echo what I <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/08/03/ldt-expo-2012-storified/">wrote back then</a>: &ldquo;Wow. This is a project to keep an eye on, and when Go Go Games comes to the iTunes Store (soon, say the team), I&rsquo;d heartily recommend this app to all families, not just those with autistic children.&rdquo; So here you have it: my hearty recommendation.</p>
<p>Go Go Games is designed to support elementary and preschool age children with autism, as I noted back in August: &ldquo;Incredibly thoughtful game design.&rdquo; The app offers a series of games &mdash; Build-A-Train, Wheels &amp; Roads, and Out of this World &mdash; that all utilize Pivotal Response Theory to help children build up the perception skills necessary to play a matching game. That perceptual capability is something essential to learning but incredibly challenging to children with Autism, and helping develop that unlocks many other learning possibilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We designed the game to feel more like play but work like therapy,&rdquo; says co-founder Alexis Hiniker &mdash; that is, reinforcing and enhancing the behavioral therapy that many Autistic children already receive through the way in which many of them also tend to spend their free time: playing video games. And the app&rsquo;s game mechanics are both thoughtful and fun, with a wonderfully designed UI and wonderfully drawn characters to boot.</p>
<p>The app has already received rave reviews during its development from parents and teachers and has also earned a 5-star rating from Common Sense Media.</p>
<p><strong>iOS, $0.99 (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go-go-games/id565022507?ls=1&amp;mt=8">iTunes link</a>)</strong></p>
