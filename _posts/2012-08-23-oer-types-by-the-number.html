<p style="text-align: center;"><em>OER Repositories, <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/08/22/oer-repositories/">Part 2</a></em></p>
<p>The data below is drawn from <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/">OER Commons</a>, a site that provides one of the best directories for finding open educational resources. OER Commons makes it easy to search by resource provider, topic, grade level, media format and license type &ndash; all important for teachers and learners looking for free and openly licensed educational materials.</p>
<h2>So what&rsquo;s available for what topics in what formats?</h2>
<p><strong>Subject Areas:</strong><br />Arts 2241 <br />Business 1218 <br />Humanities 7722 <br />Mathematics &amp; Statistics 8938 <br />Science &amp; Technology 19051 <br />Social Sciences 6684</p>
<p><strong>Grade Levels: </strong><br />Primary 7347 <br />Secondary 20430 <br />Post-secondary 25311</p>

<p><strong>The top 5 rated science textbooks for the secondary level (there were 67 total) are all in PDF format.</strong></p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s popular?</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s harder to tell.</p>
<p>You can sort by &ldquo;visits&rdquo; to see that the <strong>top video lectures in Math and Science</strong> are: <br />1. <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/courses/10th-s-and-decimals">10th&rsquo;s and Decimals</a> (from Teachers&rsquo; Domain) <br />2. <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/courses/ap-calculus-2">AP Calculus</a> (from MIT Highlights for High School) <br />3. <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/courses/ap-calculus-abi">AP Calculus</a> (from University of California College Prep) <br />4. <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/courses/conducting-effective-online-discussions">Conducting Effective Online Discussions</a> (from Learning to Teach Online) <br />5. <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/courses/algebra-one">Algebra One</a> (from University of California College Prep)</p>
<p>For a little comparison&hellip;<strong>The top 5 Khan Academy videos </strong>(again, based on visits):<br />1. <a href="http://youtu.be/gM95HHI4gLk">Salman Khan at TED</a> (1,769,506 views) <br />2. <a href="http://youtu.be/tzqMoOk9NWc">SOPA and PIPA</a> (1,422,424 views) <br />3. <a href="http://youtu.be/9Ek61w1LxSc">Simple Equations</a> (1,287,100 views) <br />4. <a href="http://youtu.be/UuMTSU9DcqQ">Khan Academy on Gates Notes</a> (1,172,871 views) <br />5. <a href="http://youtu.be/AuX7nPBqDts">Basic Addition</a> (1,148,807 views)</p>
<h2>How are things licensed?</h2>
<p><strong>Of the 678 &ldquo;Open Textbooks&rdquo; available on the site</strong>:<br />No Strings Attached 127 <br />Remix and Share 399 <br />Share Only 152</p>
<p><strong>Of the 19K &ldquo;Science and Technology&rdquo; resources:</strong> <br />Read the Fine Print 5182 <br />No Strings Attached 7929 <br />Remix and Share 5658</p>
<p><strong>Of the 2130 assessments on the site: </strong><br />No Strings Attached 130 <br />Remix and Share 1098 <br />Share Only 26 <br />Read the Fine Print 876</p>
<h2>Some Thoughts</h2>
<p>Thousands of activities, lessons, readings, videos -- that's all good news. But if you peer closely at the kinds of resources that are available and the formats that they're in, you get an interesting picture of some of the priorities in openly-licensed content. It isn't just that the topics skew STEM. It's the dearth of primary-level materials. It's the amount of test-prep (often AP-test-prep) content.&nbsp;It's the preponderance of PDFs. And even with somewhat clearer language regarding licensing ("no strings attached" and "read the fine print" as opposed to Creative Commons' terminology), the continuing confusion surrounding copyright affordances for classroom usage.</p>
