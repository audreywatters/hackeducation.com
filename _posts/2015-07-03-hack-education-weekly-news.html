<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>Governor Jerry Brown <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/us/california-mandates-vaccines-for-schoolchildren.html">signed a law</a> that ends California&#8217;s personal exemption for vaccination for school children. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/06/30/profit-chain-settles-feds-13-million">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;Education Affiliates, a for-profit chain with 50 campuses, has settled with the federal government over false-claim allegations, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The Maryland-based company agreed to pay $13 million in response to allegations that it received aid payments from unqualified students, some of whom the for-profit admitted by creating false or fraudulent high school diplomas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The US House of Representatives might vote next week on its NCLB re-write. <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0715/morningeducation18990.html">Maybe</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0715/morningeducation18990.html">Via Politico</a>: &#8220;Maine&#8217;s government watchdog panel has greenlit an investigation into whether Republican Gov. Paul LePage abused his power by pressuring a charter school to fire his political adversary, Maine Public Broadcasting reports. Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves, president of Good Will-Hinckley school, alleges he was fired after LePage threatened to block the transfer of half a million dollars in state funds to the school. LePage says that his office doesn&#8217;t qualify as a state agency and is therefore immune to the government watchdog&#8217;s probe.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/business/unpaid-internships-allowed-if-they-serve-educational-purpose-court-rules.html">Via The New York Times</a>: &#8220; Employers have considerable leeway to use unpaid interns legally when the work serves an educational purpose, a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday, setting aside a lower court decision that the movie studio Fox Searchlight Pictures had improperly classified former workers as unpaid interns rather than employees.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/07/01/supreme-court-case-poses-threat-to-teachers.html">agreed</a> to hear a case challenging public sector union&#8217;s ability to compel nonmembers to pay service fees.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/us/politics/colleges-brace-for-supreme-court-review-of-admissions.html">agreed</a> to hear (again) a challenge to affirmative action and admissions at UT Austin.</p>

<h3>Testing, Testing&#8230;</h3>
