<p>As many of you know, I&#8217;m working on a book proposal for <em><a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a></em>, a project I&#8217;ve had on the back burner for far too long now that is finally starting to come to a boil.</p>

<p>What do you think are the best existing works of history of the field of education technology?</p>

<p>Here are some titles that quickly come to mind &#8211; because I can read their titles on my bookshelf. (It&#8217;s worth noting, I suppose, that these are mostly quite dated, and they&#8217;re all by men. And I am not endorsing these as &#8220;the best.&#8221;)</p>

<ul>
<li>Larry Cuban, <em>Teachers and Machines: The Classroom Use of Technology Since 1920</em> (1986)</li>

<li>Brian Dear, <em>The Friendly Orange Glow: The Untold Story of the PLATO System and the Dawn of Cyberculture</em> (2017)</li>

<li>Bill Ferster, <em>Teaching Machines</em> (2014)</li>

<li>Bob Johnstone, <em>Never Mind the Laptops: Kids, Computers, and the Transformation of Learning</em> (2003)</li>

<li>David Noble, <em>Digital Diploma Mills</em> (2001)</li>

<li>Wilbur Schramm, <em>Bold Experiment: The Story of Educational Television in American Samoa</em> (1981)</li>

<li>Paul Saettler, <em>The Evolution of American Educational Technology</em> (1990)</li>

<li>---, <em>A History of Instructional Technology</em> (1967)</li>
</ul>

<p>I must be missing a ton here, so if you have suggestions (particularly books by authors of color or white women and particularly histories of ed-tech outside the US), <a href="mailto:mail@audreywatters.com">I&#8217;d love to hear them</a>. (And I will try to keep this article updated with new titles.)</p>
