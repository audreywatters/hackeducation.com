<p>Wow! I&rsquo;ve made it to Week 5 in a MOOC. Also, OMG!&nbsp;<a href="http://101.edstartup.net/schedule/">Ed Startup 101</a>&nbsp;lasts 16 weeks so I&rsquo;m not even a third of the way through yet!</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;ve reached a crisis moment in my participation in this MOOC, it&rsquo;s not because of its duration, a waning commitment, or my otherwise busy schedule.</p>
<h2>The Pain Test: The Results</h2>
<p>I'm really struggling as I think and write my way through the weekly assignments, as they're all framed in terms of launching a startup. Particularly challenging: <a href="/2012/09/20/ed-startup-101-week-4/">last week&rsquo;s topic of &ldquo;The Pain Test,&rdquo;</a> followed by this week&rsquo;s &mdash; how to verify that your &ldquo;pain&rdquo; is a pain for others as well, and how to move forward from there with monetization plans.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=59117">Stephen Downes</a> was among the first to push back on my post last week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I encounter this a lot in my day job. &ldquo;It&rsquo; s Week 4 of Ed Startup 101, and the class is moving on to tackle &ldquo; The Pain Test.&rdquo; That is, you might&rsquo;ve identified your idea for an education startup, but does this idea really address a problem?&rdquo; The idea of course is that your innovation - your startup - needs to address an area of genuine need. I get that, but the pain test isn&rsquo;t it. Before the iPod, people didn&rsquo;t feel the pain of not having an iPod. Before MOOCs, there was no burning need for a MOOC. The best innovations create demands for things people didn&rsquo;t realize they needed. But these invariably fail the pain test.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(With or without the iPod reference) There&rsquo;s an echo of Steve Jobs&rsquo; famous quotation there: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don&rsquo;t know what they want until you show it to them.&rdquo; Passing the pain test is not a great advancement or innovation, Downes argues.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mis-diagnosing the Pain</h2>
<p>During the recording of our&nbsp;<a href="/2012/09/23/podcast-9-21-2012/">weekly podcast</a>, Steve Hargadon too wanted to talk about my &ldquo;Pain Test&rdquo; post. We made the analogy of medical testing here, and wondered if the pain test's framing&nbsp;could actually lead to incomplete or mis-diagnoses. That is, if we identify a pain and then look to remedy it with a product or service (a bandaid), does that mean that we don't investigate more deeply, that we don't address root causes or systemic issues?</p>
<p>If the &ldquo;pain&rdquo; of a broken education system is that standardized test scores are too low, for example, the &ldquo;remedy&rdquo; could very well be more test prep apps &mdash; hey, there's a startup idea for ya! And so the disease remains untreated even if one symptom is purportedly addressed.</p>
<p>Steve also noted that despite my frustrations with much of ed-tech journalism that I had to admit in that post that the problems that I&rsquo;d identified (such as pageview-chasing and press-release-rewriting) aren&rsquo;t necessarily pains that other folks experience. Folks still read, retweet, and share on Facebook stories from [fill-in-the-blank with vapid but popular tech news source of your choice].</p>
<p>This week's assignment for Ed Startup 101 was to talk to others about this pain, ask them the same <a href="http://101.edstartup.net/pain/">questions</a>, compare notes and such. The responses from Downes, Hargadon, and other commenters offered me some insights into that, I suppose. But more importantly, they struck me that, all my frustrations with ed-tech journalism aside, writing for, and talking to, and learning with others about ed-tech is far more interesting to me than solving a problem.</p>
<p>And so can I prove I have a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanfurr/2011/10/31/the-secret-to-entrepreneurial-success-a-monetizable-pain/">monetizable pain</a>&rdquo; here on Hack Education? Frankly, that doesn&rsquo;t even feel like the right question to ask.</p>
