<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>This episode was cut a little short -- firstly by scheduling conflicts that had me rushing out the door and limiting us (ha!) to just an hour to chat, and secondly by technical difficulties that actually screwed up the audio about halfway through, just in time for our look at my weekly news roundup.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we do have a really great discussion in this podcast, particularly about my post from last week's <a href="http://101.edstartup.net/">Ed Startup 101 class</a> and how thinking about a "pain test" in education might lead to the wrong diagnosis of what's "ill" in education.</p>
