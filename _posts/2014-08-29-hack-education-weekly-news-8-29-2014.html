<h2>OMFG LAUSD</h2>
<p><strong>The LAUSD iPad clusterfuck continues</strong>.</p>
<p>Late last week, several LA news organizations <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2014/08/22/17193/internal-emails-show-la-school-officials-started-i/">obtained and published</a> emails between <strong>LAUSD</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong>, and <strong>Pearson</strong> officials. The emails reveal that <strong>Superintendent John Deasy</strong> began meeting with these companies to discuss the hardware/curriculum purchase almost a year before the multimillion dollar contract went out to bid.</p>
<p>The district agreed last year to purchase 700,000 iPads &mdash; one for every student in the district. The devices would come pre-loaded with curriculum created by Pearson. The expected cost of this project, including upgrades to the district&rsquo;s WiFi: over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Following the release of the emails &mdash; alongside a <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/ipad-report-shared-only-with-lausd-officials-in-secrecy/">highly critical report</a> from the district technology committee, Deasy announced he would <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-deasy-ipads-20140826-story.html">cancel</a> the contract with Apple. The district will reopen the bidding process.</p>
<p>No surprise, the ongoing saga is this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-22/">What You Should Know This Week</a>&rdquo; over on EML.</p>
<p>Oh and bonus: now the district says that an audit has found it is <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-ipad-audit-20140828-story.html"><strong>missing</strong></a> $2 million in computers, mostly iPads. Oops.</p>
<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p><strong>Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal</strong> is <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/apnewsbreak-jindal-suing-feds-common-core-25140660">suing</a> the Obama Administration over the <strong>Common Core</strong>. Jindal was <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Kerry">for it before he was against it</a>, just like that other one-time presidential candidate.</p>
<p>The Department of Education has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/education/oklahoma-common-core-no-child-left-behind.html">revoked</a> <strong>Oklahoma</strong>&rsquo;s <strong>NCLB waiver</strong> after the state opted to back away from the <strong>Common Core</strong>.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what that looks like in practice: 90% of <strong>Washington</strong> public schools are now considered &ldquo;failing.&rdquo; No, not because they&rsquo;re really &ldquo;failing&rdquo;; but because the US Department of Education <a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/Communications/PressReleases2014/StateTestScores.aspx">revoked the state&rsquo;s <strong>NCLB waiver</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The judge in <strong><em>Vergara v California</em></strong> <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/just-in-vergara-ruling-stands-judge-rules-in-final-review/">affirmed</a> his decision this week (that is, five state statures governing teacher employment, <strong>tenure</strong>, and <strong>seniority</strong> are unconstitutional as they deny students access to a quality public education). Defendants now have 60 days to file an appeal.</p>
<p>A judge in <strong>Texas</strong> has <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/08/28/texas-school-funding-still-unconstitutional_ap.html?cmp=RSS-FEED">affirmed</a> his decision that the state&rsquo;s <strong>school funding model</strong> is unconstitutional.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong> has a new &ldquo;<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/08/28/online-learning-push-continues-california-approach-faculty-groups-appreciate">$50 million fund</a> for &lsquo;<strong>innovation</strong>&rsquo; in the state&rsquo;s budget. The legislation created an award program that seeks to fund ideas that bubble up from California&rsquo;s public universities and community colleges.&rdquo; Certainly a different approach than attempts last year to legislate innovation (or rather, MOOCs).</p>
<p>The California Assembly has also approved a bill that would <strong>restrict companies&rsquo; use of student data</strong>, specifically ending advertising on K&ndash;12 websites and apps. <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/08/26/california-assembly-approves-student-data-privacy-bill.aspx">More via T.H.E. Journal</a>.</p>
<p>The Lee County School Board in <strong>Florida</strong> has <a href="http://www.news-press.com/story/news/education/2014/08/27/lee-county-makes-history-opts-out-of-standardized-testing/14714541/">voted</a> to <strong>opt out</strong> of state-mandated standardized tests.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong> Superintendent of Public Instruction John Huppenthal has <a href="http://www.azfamily.com/news/Top-Arizona-education-official-fights-to-keep-job-272726841.html">lost</a> his reelection bid. Huppenthal came under fire earlier this year for making offensive anonymous comments online, calling welfare recipients &ldquo;lazy pigs,&rdquo; for example. Nice work finally getting a political decision right, Arizona.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Rhode Island</strong>&rsquo;s Announces Plans To Be The First State To Go Fully Blended,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-08-27-rhode-island-s-announces-plans-to-be-the-first-state-to-go-fully-blended">says Edsurge</a>. Honest question: what is <strong>blended learning</strong>? What does it mean to be &ldquo;fully blended&rdquo;?</p>
<h2>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2014/08/20/courseras-new-goal-teaching-at-firms-such-as-mastercard/"><strong>Coursera</strong> as corporate training</a>.</p>

<p>HarvardX researcher Justin Reich <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/edtechresearcher/2014/08/navigating_the_two_kinds_of_online_discussion_forums.html">explains</a> recent changes to <strong>edX</strong>&rsquo;s <strong>discussion forums</strong>, which will now distinguish between &ldquo;asking a question and starting a discussion.&rdquo; (Wouldn't it be funny if it turned out the big contribution MOOCs make to instructional design is, finally, a revamp to discussion forums?)</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>University of New England</strong> has ended its MOOC program. The program allowed students to take certain online courses for free, then charged for the credits. &ldquo;While MOOCs will continue to be offered I am sure by some of the very big providers around the world it&rsquo;s not something that a university like UNE would go at alone,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/national/education/une_shuts_down_its_loss_making_moocs_ZQoeYL6tucYL6h5TJTAXBI">said the vice chancellor</a>. Oh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <strong>University of Oregon</strong> student was charged with five separate code-of-conduct violations for shouting a kind of funny, vaguely inappropriate four-word phrase out the window of a campus dormitory.&rdquo; <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/08/26/harassment-disorderly-conduct-charges-fo">Go Ducks</a>.</p>

<p>The for-profit college chain <strong>Anthem Education</strong> has filed for bankruptcy and shuttered several of its campuses, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/08/29/profit-anthem-education-abruptly-closes-campuses-after-filing-bankruptcy">reports Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p>Alumni groups at <strong>prestigious NYC high schools</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/nyregion/despite-racial-disparity-alumni-group-backs-test-only-policy-for-elite-schools.html">do not want</a> the city to scrap test scores as the sole criterion for admission. Many have argued that this policy keeps Black and Latino students out, and a broader admission policy could address the lack of diversity in these elite schools. But the alumni groups say that would risk &ldquo;diluting the schools&rsquo; rigorous academic atmosphere.&rdquo; Side eye.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/sports/jeffrey-kessler-envisions-open-market-for-ncaa-college-athletes.html">The New York Times profiles</a> antitrust lawyer Jeffrey Kessler.

Kuali had been an attempt to &ldquo;<strong>community-source</strong>&rdquo; school administration software, supporting universities in the creation of their own accounting, billing, research, and budgeting software rather than relying on third-party vendors. To address the problems around sustainability and the pace of software development, the org decided to switch its profit models. <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/kuali-profit-change-indicator-bigger-issues/">Solid analysis</a>, as always, from Phil Hill on what this means for higher ed-tech.</p>
