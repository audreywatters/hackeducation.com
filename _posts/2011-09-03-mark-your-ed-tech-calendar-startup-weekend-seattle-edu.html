<p><a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/06/04/startup-weekend-edu-building-an-ed-tech-startup-in-a-weekend/">Earlier this summer</a> I attended <a href="http://www.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend EDU</a> in San Francisco.  And I'm excited to be headed to another <a href="http://seattleedu.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend EDU</a> later this month, this one in a city that's known for some awesome education/technology entrepreneurs.  I love Startup Weekend -- I love the energy and enthusiasm; I love seeing what people can build over the course of a weekend.</p>
<p>Now arguably, <em>all</em> Startup Weekends are educational events:  over the course of 54 hours, you'd be amazed at how much you can learn about how to build a successful startup.  The events -- over 300 of which have been held all over the world -- have brought together entrepreneurs and engineers, along with local startup and tech leaders, for intensive weekends of learning and doing -- building a "<a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html">minimum viable product</a>."</p>
<p>Recently Startup Weekend has begun to hold events that address the education space directly. (I believe the <a href="http://kauffman.org">Kauffman Foundation</a>, the event sponsor, is looking at other specialized events too, for healthcare and clean-tech, for example.)  This makes it a perfect opportunity to open the event up beyond the tech-entrepreneurial crowd that's typically in attendance.  In the case of Startup Weekend EDU, it's a great event for parents, students, educators to attend too.  (I'd go so far as to argue, educators, that it's pretty important that you do.  See my story on <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/07/a-teacher-built-technology-tool/">MindShift</a> for a story about <a href="http://lessoncast.org">LessonCast</a>, a teacher-driven startup built at Startup Weekend SF EDU.)</p>
<p>There's only so much you can do over the course of a Startup Weekend, of course -- you pitch your ideas on Friday evening; teams are assembled; and then you work throughout Saturday and Sunday on idea validation, customer development, and coding.  Come Sunday evening, it's time to pitch your startup idea -- and a demo -- to a panel of judges.</p>
<p>So in advance of the event, there's a <a href="http://swseaedu.uservoice.com/forums/130525-edu-problems">UserVoice</a> thread discussing some of the issues and ideas that participants might want to tackle.  You're welcome to participate (and one of the event sponsors, <a href="http://teachstreet.com">TeachStreet</a> is offering <a href="http://blog.teachstreet.com/homepage/discount-startup-weekend-sea/">discount codes</a> to the event to those who do).</p>
<p><strong>So mark your calendar:  <a href="http://seattleedu.startupweekend.org/">September 30 - October 2 on the University of Washington Campus</a>.</strong> I'll be there as a mentor -- in <a href="http://blog.teachstreet.com/community-events/mentor-list-sw-sea/">very esteemed company</a>, I should add, that includes investor and technology <a href="http://blog.teachstreet.com/community-events/mitch-kapor-keynote-startup-weekend/">Mitch Kapor</a> who'll be keynoting and judging.</p>
