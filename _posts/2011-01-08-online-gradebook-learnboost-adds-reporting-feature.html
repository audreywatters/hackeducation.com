<p>The free online gradebook <a href="http://www.learnboost.com">LearnBoost</a> has added a long awaited feature: <a href="http://blog.learnboost.com/blog/reporting/">reporting</a>.</p>
<p>The new feature takes the data from the gradebook in order to generate graphics that give teachers a real-time view of students' progress.  The reporting feature has two major views:  one for a class and one for students.  The classroom displays high-level information about grades, attendance, and assignments.  The student view gives more details into an individual's performance.</p>
<p>This new feature follows in the footsteps the rest of LearnBoost's product:  it's slick and beautiful.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the LearnBoost team has built and open-sourced an implementation of HTML5 canvas called <a href="http://blog.learnboost.com/blog/introducing-node-canvas-server-side-html5-canvas-api/">node canvas</a> that allows for these graphically-rich reports to be updated in real-time.</p>
