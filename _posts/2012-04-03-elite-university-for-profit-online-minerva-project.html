<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/minerva_150.jpg" alt="" align="right" />My look at the <a href="http://www.minervaproject.com/index.html">Minerva Project</a>, a new online, for-profit "elite university" that announced today it's raised $25 million in seed funding from Benchmark Capital.</p>
<p>There's a lot of interesting stuff here -- the CEO's vision for creating an "elite university" in an age of ubiquitous and free high-quality educational content online, for starters.</p>
<p>But also noteworthy, I'd add:  that <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/120403/p46#a120403p46">all the tech blogs</a> wrote this story up first thing this morning when news crossed the wire, while both The Chronicle and Inside Higher Ed didn't have their stories up 'til later in the day.  Make of that what you will...</p>
<p>My story -- one of those "later in the day" ones, clearly -- is available <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/new-elite-university-gets-25-million-seed-funding">here</a>.</p>
