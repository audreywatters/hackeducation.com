School-Sanctioned Walkouts Rob Students of That Lesson.&#8221; I am not sure that&#8217;s not what civil disobedience means, and the students most likely to experience gun violence are probably those least in a position to protest it (or at least those likely to suffer the most from &#8220;consequences&#8221;). But damn, the authoritarian streak in education reform is sure alive and well when it comes to the topic of school discipline, isn&#8217;t it.</p>
