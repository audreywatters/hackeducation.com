<p>One of the cornerstones of the <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html">Obama Administration&rsquo;s Race to the Top</a> (RTTT) initiative has been the demand that states improve &ldquo;teacher effectiveness.&rdquo; In theory at least it&rsquo;s hard to argue with such a thing &ndash; after all, great teachers have a lasting positive impact on their students, a <a href="http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/value_added.html">major study by Harvard and Columbia professors</a> released earlier this year contended. But in practice, it&rsquo;s not so easy to say what makes a teacher &ldquo;great&rdquo; or what you mean by &ldquo;effective.&rdquo; For its part though, RTTT wants to measure this through more rigorous teacher evaluation systems, ones that are based in large part on students&rsquo; standardized test data, as well as on classroom observation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written in detail and <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/02/24/news-politics-and-educational-data-nyc-teacher-data-reports/">with great skepticism</a> about the first part of that measurement &ndash; the emphasis on <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/06/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2011-data-which-still-means-mostly-standardized-testing/">standardized test scores</a> as the abiter of &ldquo;what works&rdquo; and &ldquo;what matters&rdquo; in the classroom. There&rsquo;s no agreement that we can really ascertain a teacher&rsquo;s effectiveness (or &ldquo;value add&rdquo;) based on this data. Great teaching is so much more complex than that.</p>
<p>But that complexity isn&rsquo;t always apparent through classroom observation either, and that&rsquo;s been one of the few other measurements we have about teacher performance.</p>
<p>This is all one terribly long-winded introduction &ndash; and perhaps even a caveat &ndash; to situate a new startup called <a href="http://teachboost.com">TeachBoost</a> that&rsquo;s stepping right into the middle of the teacher evaluation maelstrom with its &ldquo;performance management platform.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a pretty bold step to take for a startup, I think, even if the RTTT rules might indicate that the market for teacher evaluation tools could be big.</p>
<p>But one thing that struck me as I talked to TeachBoost CEO Jason DeRoner last week was his great humility in building this (potentially) politically-charged product and a recognition that he and his engineering-heavy team (with no classroom teaching experience among the founders) were going to have to take a lot of cues from schools about what the tool would need to do.</p>
<p>DeRoner also repeatedly stressed the importance of trust &ndash; trust in TeachBoost, sure, but also trust among administrators and classroom educators. This isn&rsquo;t about surveillance, DeRoner insisted, but about &ldquo;safe feedback&rdquo; and collaboration: teachers and administrators working together to set and attain professional goals.</p>

<p>The design and workflow of TeachBoost are geared in part towards mobile usage; the idea is to make it easier for principals to take notes and make ratings during classroom visits. (It&rsquo;s the old challenge of an app replacing paper.) TeachBoost offers a mobile Web app so that principals can use any sort of device &ndash; laptop or iPad, for example &ndash; to jot down what they see during walkthroughs. As a Web app, the information is secure in the cloud and accessible via the same interface when they&rsquo;re back at their desks.</p>

<p>TeachBoost can be customized so that it includes evaluation rubrics that are required by the state as well as additional questions and goals that teachers and principals establish together. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any &lsquo;gotchas&rsquo;,&rdquo; says DeRoner. And teachers too are encouraged to submit their own documentation and data to their TeachBoost profiles. Again, a single classroom observation can never really capture a teacher&rsquo;s effectiveness.</p>
<p>But observations alone should not be the end-game. In other words, even if a principal does write down notes about a teacher&rsquo;s performance, then what? So what? DeRoner argues that a tool should do more than just monitor performance&nbsp; and as such he describes TeachBoost as a &ldquo;teacher development platform." He says the tool should help match teachers with mentors and help schools develop their own expertise and form their own learning networks based on teachers&rsquo; strengths.</p>
