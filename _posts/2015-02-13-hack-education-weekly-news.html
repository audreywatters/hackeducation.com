<h3>RIP</h3>
<br />
<p>RIP Deah Barakat (age 23). Yusor Mohammad (age 21). Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. (age 19).</p>

<p>Deah Barakat <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/chapel-hill-shooting-three-young-muslims-gunned-down-in-north-carolina-at-their-family-home-10037734.html">was</a> a dental student at UNC. Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha had started her architecture degree at North Carolina State University. They were murdered this week by a neighbor. They were full of hope and promise and commitment to a better world. &#8220;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/02/three-muslims-shot-in-chapel-hill-Craig-Stephen-Hicks/385383/">The Killing of Three Young Muslims in Chapel Hill</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>Following investigative reports <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/7/71/352887/deborah-quazzo-companies-got-1-3-million-cps-funded-charters">from the Chicago Sun-Times</a> about profits to her ed-tech portfolio after she joined the Chicago school board, GSV co-founder Deborah Quazzo sent an angry mass email this week saying &#8220;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/enough-is-enough-education-investor-denounces-meddling-journ#.xsx14eDg1">ENOUGH IS ENOUGH</a>!&#8221; No more hard questions from the public or the Fifth Estate! Time to invest in <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gsv-capital/insights/categories/education/025caab73e5498f0061c73e7af159cd1">moar ed-tech publications or something</a>. </p>

<p>Great reporting from Politico&#8217;s Stephanie Simon on <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/pearson-education-115026.html">the politics of Pearson</a>.</p>

<p>No Child Left Behind &#8211; the reauthorization of the law, that is &#8211; is <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0215/morningeducation17036.html">still</a> being debated. While Congress is at it, perhaps FERPA &#8211; which is almost as old as me &#8211; will be <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/02/ferpa_update_student_data_privacy.html">updated</a> as DC looks to revamp student privacy measures. Perhaps.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/virginia-passes-bill-to-rein-in-restraints-of-school-kids">ProPublica reports</a> that &#8220;Virginia lawmakers have passed a bill requiring state leaders to set limits on how public schools can restrain or isolate students.&#8221; (ProPublica has been working on stories about these practices in schools.)</p>

<p>The South Carolina legislature has <a href="http://www.thestate.com/2015/02/10/3980563_house-panel-votes-to-close-sc.html?rh=1">passed</a> a budget plan that would prevent SC State University (a HBCU) from holding classes or athletic events for the next two years. &#8220;The school would reopen under new leadership in the fall of 2017. The 3,000 students at the state's only historically black public college could get state scholarships to attend other S.C. public colleges or any historically black university.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kansas Governor Sam Brownback has moved to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/02/12/kansas-universities-will-keep-protections-gay-people">end protections</a> for state employees on the basis of sexual orientation. But Kansas&#8217; public universities say that they will keep policies in place that prevent discrimination.</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p>In news that should surprise no one, for-profit education providers have <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/02/09/profit-group-files-motion-gainful-employment-suit">filed a motion</a> relating to the latest Department of Education rules about &#8220;gainful employment.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.al.com/news/tuscaloosa/index.ssf/2015/02/ex-university_of_alabama_instr.html">Via AL.com</a>: &#8220;A former University of Alabama contract instructor faces a felony ethics charge after he allegedly made more than $375,000 by encouraging students to buy textbooks from a company he owned.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-02-13/judge-rejects-uis-attempt-dismiss-salaita-foia-suit.html">According to The News-Gazette</a>, a judge has rejected the University of Illinois&#8217;s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit by Steven Salaita, a professor whose tenured job offer was rescinded following social media updates he made supporting Palestinians. Salaita&#8217;s lawsuit involves a FOIA suit to obtain documents relating to his employment.</p>

<p>A district judge in Idaho has <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2015/02/11/3640728_judge-voids-broadband-contract.html">voided</a> the state&#8217;s broadband contract (which supports its school broadband program), arguing that the state violated procurement laws when it gave CenturyLink (formerly Qwest) the deal to provide schools broadband. </p>

<h3>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h3>
<br />
<p>Bill Gates is guest-editing the tech blog The Verge. So we get <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/11/8014563/bill-gates-education-future-of-online-courses-third-world">this</a>: &#8220;Can online classrooms help the developing world catch up?&#8221; Edsurge rewrites the story <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-02-13-can-moocs-change-to-better-help-women-in-developing-countries">with this headline</a>: &#8220;Can MOOCs Better Help Women in Developing Countries?&#8221; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harvard and MIT are being <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/education/harvard-and-mit-sued-over-failing-to-caption-online-courses.html">sued</a> under the Americans With Disabilities Act. The complaint contends that the universities violated that act by failing to (among other things) close caption MOOCs. </p>

<p>So yeah. Who are MOOCs helping again? Oh right. Corporations.</p>

<br />
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/us/disputed-admissions-at-university-of-texas.html">The New York Times reports</a> that &#8220;A &#8216;select handful&#8217; of University of Texas applicants are approved each year at the direction of the school president over the objections of the admissions office, a longtime practice that has grown in recent years, according to an investigation commissioned by the university’s Board of Regents and released Thursday.&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_v._University_of_Texas">Paging Abigail Fisher</a>?</p>

Will Not Admit Iranian Students to Schools of Engineering and Natural Sciences.&#8221; (And it looks like the for-profit Kaplan is doing something similar.) So when you hear the tech sector and the for-profit ed sector and the publications that promote their story say &#8220;everyone should learn to code,&#8221; you know there&#8217;s an asterisk there. * Not <em>everyone</em>. </p>

<br />
<p>Indiana is looking to shorten its standardized testing, <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0215/morningeducation17106.html">says Politico</a>, &#8220;after learning it could take students up to 12 hours to complete the exams.&#8221;</p>

<p>Remember how last year the University of Alabama Birmingham said it was going to cancel its football program in order to save money? Yeah. I guess people have complained.
