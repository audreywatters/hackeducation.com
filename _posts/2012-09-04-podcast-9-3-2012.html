<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>We recorded this podcast yesterday -- Labor Day here in the U.S., but hey, no rest for the wicked. In this week's episode, we discuss the bundling of digital textbooks with tuition, peer review, death and dropping out, and more.</p>
<p>The link to the MP3 of the show is below, and/or you can subscribe to  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/edtechlive/hackeducation">the podcast feed</a>.
