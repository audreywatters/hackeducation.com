<p><em>"With or without aversive contingencies, it is easy to 'lose our pigeon' and the student never becomes a reader" -- B. F. Skinner,</em> The Technology of Teaching</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit tardy on writing up my thoughts on the &#8220;rebranding,&#8221; if you will, of Hack Education &#8211; namely, the addition of new logos drawn by the wonderful <a href="http://bryanmmathers.com/">Bryan Mathers</a>.</p>

<p>Bryan and I had a couple of chats via Skype in order to help him design the imagery that I wanted. We talked at length about pigeons and behaviorism and ed-tech criticism and steampunk. He came back with several sketches, from which I chose the ideas I like the best: </p>

<p>(I&#8217;m planning on ordering laptop stickers (and t-shirts &#8211; at least for me) with these images. More details to come&#8230;)</p>

<p>Talking with Bryan prompted me to <a href="http://pigeons.hackeducation.com/2016/04/27/a-new-subdomain">clarify</a> a bit why the pigeon is such an intriguing figure to me, and I plan to develop some of these ideas into a keynote I&#8217;m delivering this fall at <a href="http://www.designsonelearning.net/">DeL</a>. The theme of that conference is &#8220;Anxiety and Security&#8221; and certainly the pigeon is a bird that seems to crystallize some of our fears &#8211; disgust mostly &#8211; about urbanization. It&#8217;s a bird that crystallizes some of my fears &#8211; and also disgust &#8211; about ed-tech.</p>

<p>I chose the pigeon as a motif for Hack Education a couple of years ago, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/12/25/pigeons">as I&#8217;ve written previously</a>, because of the role the bird played in the development of educational psychology and education technology. (Sidenote: I&#8217;m a little frustrated by <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/16/train-future-ed-tech-leaders-higher-ed-needs-new-discipline-some-say">recent pronouncements</a> that education technology needs to have its own discipline. Once again, the lack of historicism by ed-tech&#8217;s advocates is striking.) The pigeon is probably most closely associated with B. F. Skinner and his work on operant conditioning, but earlier scientists &#8211; including those who founded the field of modern educational psychology, such as Edward Thorndike &#8211; also worked with animals and built various devices to test their intelligence.</p>

<p>When I told Bryan that I wish ed-tech could be &#8220;less pigeon,&#8221; I meant that I wanted my work to both highlight the longstanding relationship between behaviorism and testing &#8211; built into the ideology and the infrastructure since ed-tech&#8217;s origins in the early twentieth century &#8211; and to remind people that there are also alternatives to treating students like animals to be trained.</p>

<p>To be clear, the command to &#8220;be less pigeon&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t be seen as any slight on the pigeon itself. Indeed, I find the bird to be quite beautiful and more than a little subversive. Its plumage, captured so well by Bryan, often shimmers with a surprising iridescence. Some species of the bird are incredibly striking &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_crowned_pigeon">the headdress on the Victoria crowned pigeon</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the black, white, and grey pigeons commonly found in cities elicit strong negative opinions and stern city policies &#8211; &#8220;Do not feed the pigeons! &#8211; (as well as lots of questions about why I&#8217;d think to use pigeon imagery so liberally across my websites). But our hatred of these birds (and by &#8221;our&quot; I should clarify that I mean specifically North American and Western European) is very recent. It&#8217;s only been in the last century or so that we&#8217;ve distinguished the pigeon from the dove. The dove has retained its symbolic power as a bird of peace; the pigeon is now seen as a marker of defilement, of urban decay.</p>

<p>The rock pigeon was domesticated some 5000 years ago. Today&#8217;s city-dwelling pigeons are the feral ancestors of these domesticated birds. They are the ancestors of the pigeons that escaped. They are neither domesticated nor wild. They are &#8211; <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo3645022.html">with apologies to Donna Haraway here</a> &#8211; a companion species gone awry, a border creature that might mark its own and our own trainability, a reminder of what happens when our cyborg fantasies, despite their subversive theoretical promise, turn out to be quite submissive to the technologies of command and control.</p>
