<p>My son graduated from high school in June of last year. He opted not to go to college. He didn&rsquo;t want to. I didn&rsquo;t pressure him.</p>
<p>There are a thousand reasons why he&rsquo;s made the right choice, and just as many why he has -- and by extension, I have -- made the wrong one.</p>
<p>He never liked school much. His favorite classes -- wood shop, gardening, cooking -- aren&rsquo;t part of the curriculum of a typical four year degree. This time last year, he wasn&rsquo;t sure what he wanted to do after high school graduation, but he was fairly adamant, after barely escaping his K-12 stint with a diploma, that &ldquo;more school&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>He said he&rsquo;d rather find a job, take the time to figure things out. Of course, that&rsquo;s easier said than done these days. There aren&rsquo;t a lot of opportunities for someone with no college degree, no work experience, and no family connections. (Of course, there&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/business/2012/04/536-young-graduates-dont-have-jobs/51459/">aren&rsquo;t a lot of opportunities</a>, period.)</p>
<p>Unemployed and uneducated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good start to his adult life, my parents keep fretting. How will he ever amount to anything without a college degree? How can he afford&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to go to college, they worry.</p>
<p>Theirs is a different worry than seems to be making headlines lately: that is, how can students&nbsp;<em>afford</em>&nbsp;college? How can students afford their loan debt? What sorts of restrictions does this debt -- about $25,000 on average per student, and over $1 trillion in outstanding debt all told -- place on students? Of all the opportunity that college promises to give, what doors are closed when you are saddled with the burdens of loans?</p>
<p>As someone who, at 40, still struggles to make her monthly Sallie Mae payments, I can relate. Of course, I&rsquo;ve figured out what I want to do with my life. Pressures of student loan debt be damned, I&rsquo;m a writer.</p>
<p>My son, not quite 19, hasn&rsquo;t figured out what he wants to do with his life. He&rsquo;s still under the fog of youth -- a fog that makes long-term planning seem ridiculous, a fog that a university education may or may not help lift.</p>
<p>That fog has laid thickly over the last twelve months of his life. Despite the freedom of &ldquo;no debt&rdquo; and &ldquo;no school,&rdquo; he hasn&rsquo;t really done much with his time. We&rsquo;re not affluent enough, I don&rsquo;t think, to call this a &ldquo;gap year.&rdquo; There have been no trips to Europe. There&rsquo;s no admissions to a private school on hold until the fall semester. I&rsquo;ve subsidized his world, just as I promised him I would. The Mom Grant, not the Pell Grant, if you will. (And no loans.)</p>
<p>But recently (as I hoped) he&rsquo;s made a decision about &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s decided that this summer he&rsquo;s moving (from Oregon) to Maine. My little brother lives there, and I think my son is attracted to what he sees as a community that&rsquo;s more interested in building and making than the book-ish community he associates with college.</p>
<p>Jobs are still scarce in Maine, but he says he&rsquo;s certain he&rsquo;ll find more opportunity there -- farming, construction, or boat-building. He says he hopes he can find apprenticeships to learn those things. He says he wants to work, work hard, and work with his hands.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t work out, he shrugs, he can always go back to school.</p>
