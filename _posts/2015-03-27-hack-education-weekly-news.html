Jared Polis, the bill came under fire for <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/privacy-bill-wouldnt-stop-data-mining-of-kids-116299.html">doing little to protect student privacy</a> &#8211; &#8220;It’s riddled with &#8216;huge loopholes&#8217; and &#8216;escape clauses,&#8217;&#8221; EPIC&#8217;s Khaliah Barnes <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0315/morningeducation17575.html">told Politico</a>.

<p>&#8220;The U.S. Department of Education is so concerned about the risk that dozens of colleges pose to students and taxpayers that it has curtailed access to federal money at those institutions &#8211; but it won’t say which ones,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/03/26/education-dept-keeps-secret-names-colleges-found-be-risky-students-taxpayers">reports Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
