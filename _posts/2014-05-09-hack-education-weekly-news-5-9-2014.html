<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>The kidnap of almost 300 girls from a boarding school in <strong>Nigeria</strong> last month is <a href="https://twitter.com/FLOTUS/status/464148654354628608">getting more attention</a>, sure, <a href="https://medium.com/message/3c3ab5d1dc0e">but the girls are still missing</a>&nbsp;(and other abductions are still happening).&nbsp;Amnesty International <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/09/world/africa/nigeria-abducted-girls/">said</a> today that the Nigerian military knew about Boko&nbsp;<span>Haram's plans to kidnap the girls, but did not act in time.</span></p>
<p>The <strong>US Supreme Court</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/nyregion/supreme-court-allows-prayers-at-town-meetings.html">ruled 5&ndash;4</a> that the Constitution does allow town meetings to start with a sectarian <strong>prayer</strong>. So that <strong>First Amendment</strong> thing? Yeah. (In related news, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/us/politics/in-justices-votes-free-speech-often-means-speech-i-agree-with.html">for Supreme Court justices, &ldquo;Free Speech Often Means &lsquo;Speech I Agree With.&rsquo;&rdquo;</a>)</p>
<p><strong>NewSchools Venture Fund</strong> CEO <strong>Ted Mitchell</strong> has been <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/146451/">confirmed</a> as Under Secretary of Higher Education. He&rsquo;ll replace Martha Kanter to become the Department of Education&rsquo;s highest ranking official. Congrats to his investment portfolio.</p>
<p>The <strong>Department of Education</strong> and <strong>Department of Justice</strong> have <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/edu/documents/plylerletter.pdf">released new guidelines</a> about <strong>undocumented students</strong> in public schools: &ldquo;we have become aware of student enrollment practices that may chill or discourage the participation, or lead to the exclusion, of students based on their or their parents&rsquo; or guardians&rsquo; actual or perceived citizenship or immigration status. These practices contravene Federal law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A court order last year forced <strong>Boston College</strong> to release to the Police Service of <strong>Northern Ireland</strong> the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/world/europe/boston-college-says-it-will-return-interviews-about-northern-ireland.html">transcripts of interviews</a> conducted as part of an oral history project on The Troubles. Content from these led to the <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-05-02/murder-gerry-adams-and-protecting-professors">arrest this week of former Sinn Fein leader <strong>Gerry Adams</strong></a> in a murder investigation.</p>
<p>The <strong>Florida</strong> legislature has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/05/01/4091426/fla-legislature-passes-school.html">passed a bill</a> that would let parents object to textbooks used in public schools. I can&rsquo;t imagine <em>anything</em> going wrong with that, eh? And I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I really cannot friggin&rsquo; wait for the 2016 Presidential Campaign when Governor Jeb Bush points to his state as a shining example of education reform!</p>
<p>The US House of Representatives has <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2014/05/bill_to_make_federal_education.html">passed a bill</a> that would reauthorize the <strong>Education Sciences Reform Act</strong>, &ldquo;with an eye toward making federal K&ndash;12 research more relevant and timely for those out in the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A class-action lawsuit was filed this week against the <strong>Maricopa County Community College District</strong> over a computer security breach last year that exposed the personal information of more than 2.4 million people,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2014/05/02/lawsuit-filed-maricopa-districts-security-breach/8619189/">reports The Arizona Central</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>White House</strong> released a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/05/01/findings-big-data-and-privacy-working-group-review">report</a> from its <strong>Big Data and Privacy working group</strong> that looks at the impact (and ethics) of big data-related technologies. You can read more about this over on Educating Modern Learners, where I picked this as the topic for my weekly &ldquo;<a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-6/">What You Should Know This Week</a>&rdquo; story (even though I probably should have picked the Pearson/PARCC thing. See below.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teens Blame <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> for Their &lsquo;Nasty&rsquo; Tater Tot-Free Lunches,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/05/teens-blame-michelle-obama-for-their-nasty-tater-tot-free-lunches/361296/">says The Wire</a>. Students are upset about the new nutrition guidelines for school lunches and are now reportedly throwing away their food. Because salad. Also this is clearly Michelle Obama's fault. Because Bengazi.</p>
<h2>Woohoo! Testing!</h2>
<p><strong>Pearson</strong> has <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/05/pearson_wins_major_contract_from_common-core_testing_consortium.html">won</a> the highly lucrative contract to develop and administer the tests for the <strong>Common Core</strong> testing consortium Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (<strong>PARCC</strong>). The states that are part of PARCC collectively educate about 15 million students. So let's see: 15 million times $29.50 per test... Pearson was the only organization to bid for the contract. Side eye.</p>
<p>The <strong>American Institutes for Research</strong> (AIR), another player in the testing industry, has <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/05/american_institutes_for_research_challenges_pearson_common-core_testing_award_in_court.html">filed a lawsuit</a> arguing that the <strong>PARCC</strong> contract was awarded &ldquo;in a process that was illegal, and structured in a way that wrongly benefited one company&mdash;<strong>Pearson</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latest results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (<strong>NAEP</strong>) show <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2014/05/no_change_in_12th_grade_perfor.html">no change</a> in US high school seniors&rsquo; performance in reading or math. You are free to interpret this information however you like, to justify your beliefs on education policy past, present, future.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/06/oecd-pisa-tests-education-joy-of-learning">A letter signed by 120 academics</a> &ldquo;argues the <strong>OECD</strong>&rsquo;s Programme for International Student Assessment (<strong>Pisa</strong>) tests on 15-year-olds distort the curriculum, reduce teachers&rsquo; autonomy and increase children&rsquo;s stress levels.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/05/06/30fieldtest_ep.h33.html">EdWeek reports</a> &ldquo;few field-testing snags&rdquo; in the new <strong>Common Core</strong> exams.</p>
<p>Here's one snag: &ldquo;<a href="http://accomplishedcaliforniateachers.wordpress.com/2014/05/07/sb/">&lsquo;Sorry I cannot write more&rsquo; &ndash; A <strong>Smarter Balanced</strong> Tale</a>&rdquo;</p>

Chris deserves a ton of credit for the push for more computer science education in schools (even though she's never been interviewed by Ryan Seacrest or made videos with Mark Zuckerberg like those Code.org fellas have).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <strong>National Labor Relations Board</strong> is reviewing a federal law that permits private employers to bar workers from using company email accounts for union activities,&rdquo; <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/labor-board-to-review-law-on-use-of-employer-email-for-union-activity/52305">The Chronicle of Higher Education reports</a>.</p>
