<h2>Why (Not) Wikipedia?</h2>
<p>A  couple of weeks ago, a story made the rounds (and admittedly I included  it in the EML newsletter) that perhaps served to confirm some of the  worst fears that educators have about Wikipedia: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.dailydot.com/lol/amelia-bedelia-wikipedia-hoax/">I accidentally started a Wikipedia hoax</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  story tells of two college students&rsquo; late-night decision to edit the  Wikipedia entries for a handful of children&rsquo;s book authors with  fabricated information. Wikipedia is known, of course, for its community  of editors that are quick to challenge, if not reverse, changes to  articles. But for whatever reason, this particular fabrication <a href="https://twitter.com/jaycaspiankang/status/493525722237911040/photo/1">stuck</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Amelia  Bedelia&rsquo;s character is based on a maid in Cameroon, where the author  spent some time during her formative years. Her vast collection of hats,  notorious for their plumage, inspired Parish to write an assortment of  tales on her experiences in North.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those two  sentences, not just un-cited and unsubstantiated but totally wrong, were  cited by multiple other (mainstream!) publications. I mean, it was in  the Wikipedia entry, right? This story of the Cameroon connection became  "the truth" of Amelia Bedelia -- that is, until the story of the hoax  was published, and Wikipedia editors removed these sentences and locked  the entry to further changes.</p>
<p>No doubt, the story confirms some of  our worst suspicions about Wikipedia, and so, some people will be quick  to argue, students should be discouraged from using it.</p>
<p>How can  we trust Wikipedia when the crowd-sourced online encyclopedia is open to  these sorts of errors. Cue the litany of stories like &ldquo;<a href="http://readwrite.com/2012/09/12/why-wikipedia-doesnt-belong-in-the-classroom">Why Wikipedia Doesn&rsquo;t Belong in the Classroom</a>."</p>
<p>But  all of the hand-wringing about a couple of incorrect sentences a single  entry misses the point, argues Mike Caulfield, who responded to the  &ldquo;Amelia Bedelia hoax&rdquo; by arguing her &ldquo;<a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/08/02/amelia-bedelias-hats-are-not-the-problem/">hats are not the problem</a>&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;In a world where Elsevier was recently discovered to have published <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/27383/title/Elsevier-published-6-fake-journals/">half a dozen fake journals for drug companies</a>, a world where more recently <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/08/sage-publications-busts-peer-review-and-citation-ring-60-papers-retracted/">60 articles were retracted from the Journal of Vibration and Control</a> due to a &lsquo;citation ring,&rsquo; and a world where med research postdocs are faking anti-cancer trials <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2014/08/01/md-anderson-postdoc-faked-results-of-novartis-anti-cancer-compound-study/">and still working</a>, I&rsquo;m not sure to what we&rsquo;re comparing this &lsquo;hoax.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In what might not seem immediately like related news, comedian John Oliver recently denounced &ldquo;<a href="http://youtu.be/E_F5GxCwizc">native advertising</a>&rdquo; on his news analysis show <em>Last Week Tonight.</em> &ldquo;Native advertising&rdquo; is the practice of news organizations (<a href="http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/clickhole-or-die-the-fight-over-sponsored-content-is-1-1616519162/+mattnovak">not a new practice</a>,  for what it&rsquo;s worth) publishing content that&rsquo;s sponsored by (or even  written by) advertisers designed to look just like &ldquo;news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In  other words, we cannot simply trust the veracity of published materials.  We cannot simply trust &ldquo;the news.&rdquo; We cannot simply trust Wikipedia. We  cannot simply trust magazines. We cannot simply trust the Internet. We  need to maintain our critical reading skills no matter the publisher or  the author, no matter the weight of the print copy or the "weight" of  the URL.</p>
<h2>New Critical Literacies</h2>
<p>Caulfield  points to other interesting updates to the &ldquo;Amelia Bedelia&rdquo; Wikipedia  entry that have since been removed. For example, one that lasted a few  months in 2007:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The name &lsquo;Bedelia&rsquo; is a  derivation of the common Irish name Bridget. Irish maids were portrayed  as being comically inept in the vaudeville theaters of New England in  the late19th century. A popular joke of the period has a maid instructed  to &lsquo;Serve the tomatoes undressed&rsquo;; she brings the dish to the dining  room, wearing only her underclothes, saying, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t take off another  stitch- not if I lose my place, Maam.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That update was deleted without discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  the beloved Amelia Bedelia a protracted Irish Maid joke?&rdquo; asks  Caulfield, &ldquo;a sanitized relic of a previous age when the Irish weren&rsquo;t  yet considered &ldquo;white&rdquo;? That seems a rather important question for a  scholarly work. And after reading about the potential vaudeville  connection, it&rsquo;s hard to un-see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The problem with Wikipedia,  Caulfield argues, is that it forces a sort of consensus about what&rsquo;s  &ldquo;worth knowing&rdquo; about a particular entry. &ldquo;When those networks are too  centralized, or hold a monopoly on truth, minority concerns get lost,  deleted, and overruled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, you <em>can</em> view the history of each Wikipedia articles and track all the changes. You <em>can</em> view the discussion on each entry as well. There is a certain layer of  transparency there &ndash; unlike the decision-making processes that go into  more formal publications. Despite all the problems with Wikipedia&rsquo;s  editorial process &ndash; <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/90-of-wikipedias-editors-are-male-heres-what-theyre-doing-about-it/280882/">the lack of women</a>,  for example, and the site&rsquo;s reputation for being viciously unwelcome to  new editors &ndash; it is possible to trace how entries evolve.</p>
<p>But do  we teach this? Do we help students understand how Wikipedia works &ndash; for  good and for bad? And how do we help them understand how traditional  peer review and traditional publishing works?</p>
<p><em>How often do  you, as an educator, use Wikipedia? What steps do you take to ascertain  the veracity of the material you've found there?</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/11/04/reading-writing-and-research-in-the-digital-age/">According to a survey by the Pew Research Center</a>, 94% of students say they&rsquo;re &ldquo;very likely&rdquo; to use Google in a research assignment. <strong>75% say they&rsquo;re &ldquo;very likely&rdquo; to use Wikipedia</strong>.  42% say they turn to their peers for help with research. 17% say they  look at an online research database. 16% say they ask a librarian.</p>
<p>Wikipedia usage is part of a <a href="http://modernlearners.com/new-literacies-in-the-classroom/">new literacy</a> that digital technology affords us. Yet Wikipedia is often dismissed,  if not banned in the classroom. (Indeed, some schools go as far as to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071126/032821.shtml">block Wikipedia</a> on their networks.)</p>
<h2>Rethinking Literacies, Rethinking Assessments</h2>
<p>When  we talk about rethinking literacy in the classroom, we must rethink  academia's "ban" on Wikipedia. But that's really only a starting place.  (Some educators have worked with the organization, making updating and  creating entries assignments for their classes.) If nothing else, we  have to recognize that an introduction to new literacies in the  classroom probably has to start with the technologies students are most  apt to turn to when they conduct the research that schools demand they  do: search engines and Wikipedia.</p>
<p>And we should ask as well: How  do we assess these new literacies? How do educators conduct and share  "research"? How are they assessed for doing so? Do our current  assessment practices that purportedly gauge student literacy &ndash; ones that  still focus on that &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; notion of reading and writing &ndash;  prevent us from developing new literacy skills? How do old assessments  and old beliefs about "what counts" as "research" prevent us from giving  these new literacies sufficient time and attention in the classroom?</p>
