<p>For the last couple of years, I&rsquo;ve been asking teachers to tell me the one new tool that they&rsquo;re most looking forwarding to taking back into the classroom with them this fall. With Labor Day now behind us and with most schools back in session, I&rsquo;m happy to share the results of <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/29/most-anticipated-back-to-school-tech-tools-survey/">my latest survey</a>.</p>
<h2>The Top 3</h2>
<p><a href="http://instructure.com">Instructure Canvas</a> <br /><a href="http://plus.google.com">Google+</a> <br /><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a></p>
<h2>The Rest</h2>
<p>A couple of things that struck me about this year&rsquo;s results:</p>
<p><strong>1. &nbsp;</strong>As in the past, there was <strong>a diverse set of responses</strong>. Many of the tools mentioned were just mentioned once. There was excitement for both hardware (LED projectors, piano keyboards) and software (apps galore), with a definite nod towards mobile devices (with iPads, text-messaging apps, apps in general). However, unlike previous back-to-school seasons, where there was a clear trendy product &mdash; oh, say, iPads &mdash; there was an even wider range of tools mentioned this fall. More responses; more tools. An excitement about education technology in general, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>&nbsp;And yet, <strong>little has changed</strong> over the last couple of years in terms of the most popular tools mentioned. Folks are still excited for Google+ and Edmodo (broadly speaking, social networking in schools). And everyone still is gaga for iPads.</p>
<p><strong>3. &nbsp;Wait, what? A learning management system?</strong> What is Instructure doing on the list this year?! Everyone hates their LMS, right? Except, it looks like, not really. This is the part where I have to interject here that this is a pretty informal survey circulated to my social networks, and so maybe Instructure retweeted the story and an overwhelming number of happy clients answered. But that&rsquo;s the thing, right? <em>A bunch of happy LMS clients answered. </em>People are excited about an LMS.</p>
<p><em></em><strong>4. </strong>Thankfully,<strong>&nbsp;the Maker Movement is penetrating the classroom</strong>. 3D printers, the Kickstarter-ed project <a href="http://www.makeymakey.com/">Makey Makey</a> (&ldquo;the invention kit for everyone&rdquo;), Lego robotics kits &mdash; lots of teachers are excitedly planning hands-on learning experiences with their students (which I interpret as lots of teachers who&rsquo;ve spent the summer making &mdash; awesome).</p>
<p><strong>5. Google&rsquo;s education product line is fragmented, but much-beloved</strong>. Google+ was one of the most frequently mentioned tools in this survey (particularly popular among followers who responded on G+, I should note). But there were lots of mentions of other Google products too: Google Hangouts. The Nexus. Google Apps for Education. It&rsquo;s clear that Apple has a lot of education&rsquo;s hardware mindshare with the iPad. And that comes with an app ecosystem too, of course. But Google is right there too with its cloud-based offerings. What <em>are</em> Google&rsquo;s plans for EDU? (No one mentioned Chromebooks!)</p>
