<p>Ten years ago today, I bought the domain hackeducation.com and launched this website, determined to do a better job covering the revival of ed-tech startups than the technology press did. Hack Education has changed a lot in the past decade. I no longer model this site on those publications. I've turned toward criticism and analysis and away from reporting. Hack Education remains, I think, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2019/12/31/what-a-shitshow">a chronicle of the last ten years in education technology</a>. It's become a record of the many public talks I've given. I am so proud of this work.</p>

<p>I do recognize that my updates here have been infrequent in the last year or so, as I've focused on my book. I should have written something longer today, worthy of commemorating this anniversary. But I haven't. (I will have <a href="https://hewn.substack.com">a newsletter</a> out this weekend, hopefully. Maybe.)</p>

<p>Instead, I want to thank you for all your <a href="https://www.patreon.com/audreywatters">support</a>. </p>
