<p>I have updated my <a href="funding.hackeducation.com">Ed-Tech Funding</a> project with <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/03/01/february">the dollars and deals from February</a>. This past month, ed-tech startups raised $566,950,000. </p>

<p>But there&#8217;s an asterisk by that figure as it includes $500,000,000 raised by <em>one</em> company, student loan provider SoFi &#8211; money that SoFi says it plans to use to &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/24/sofi-500m-silver-lake/">push beyond lending</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many ed-tech publications do not count SoFi as &#8220;ed-tech,&#8221; preferring to label it as &#8220;fintech&#8221; and thereby excluding it and other student loan startups from their calculations. Edsurge, for example, does not include student loan startups in the &#8220;ka-ching!&#8221; reports it sells <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-12-21-christmas-bonus-us-edtech-sets-record-with-1-85-billion-raised-in-2015">as</a> it says it only considers ed-tech to be those &#8220;technology companies whose primary purpose is to improve outcomes for all learners, regardless of age.&#8221; </p>

<p>But that isn&#8217;t a particularly helpful delineation in my mind. Would a student information system or any sort of administrative software fall under that definition? Isn&#8217;t the point of financial aid &#8211; public and private &#8211; ostensibly &#8220;to improve outcomes&#8221;? Does a messaging app like Yik Yak count? It was marketed to students after all. Does a company that offers career assistance to college students count? <em>Why not?</em> (And you can&#8217;t say &#8220;because it doesn&#8217;t improve learning.&#8221; Most ed-tech doesn&#8217;t actually &#8220;improve learning,&#8221; let&#8217;s be honest.)</p>

<p>I try to cast a wide net when I include companies in my funding research because I want to be able to have as full a picture as possible about the types of education companies that are getting funded. But I&#8217;m also incredibly interested in <em>the types of market opportunities that venture capitalists have identified in education</em>. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s why excluding private student loans from &#8220;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/research/special-reports/state-of-edtech-2016/funding">the state of ed-tech</a>&#8221; strikes me as so dangerous if not disingenuous. Ignore student loan startups, and you have a very skewed sense of what the priorities are for investors, all of whom are actively trying to shape the narratives about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/16/what-betsy-devos-means-for-edtech/">the future of education</a>. Think Peter Thiel and his proclamation of a &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/10/peter-thiel-were-in-a-bubble-and-its-not-the-internet-its-higher-education/">college bubble</a>.&#8221; Think Ryan Craig and that mantra about the &#8220;<a href="http://universityventures.com/publications.php?title=the-great-unbundling">unbundling</a>&#8221; of higher ed. (<a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/12/07/loans">Both partners in VC firms that are investors in student loan startups</a>, funnily enough.)</p>

<p>Tressie McMillan Cottom&#8217;s new book, <em>Lower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy</em>, is particularly useful in thinking about the &#8220;financialization&#8221; of education. (And there&#8217;s a reason why she and I have described &#8220;coding bootcamps&#8221; as &#8220;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/11/23/bootcamps-the-new-for-profit-higher-ed">the new for-profit higher ed</a>.&#8221;) Well beyond the push for &#8220;everyone learn to code,&#8221; it&#8217;s worth considering how digital technologies &#8211; in the classroom, in administrators&#8217; offices, in human resources departments, at home &#8211; have become a core part of the &#8220;Wall-Street&#8221;-ification of education.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/researchgate-raised-52-million-goldman-bill-gates-2017-2">news broke</a> that ResearchGate, a social network for scholars, had raised $52.6 million&#8230; back in November 2015. When Business Insider asked the founder why he hadn&#8217;t disclosed the investment (until required by law to do so by the German government), he said that &#8220;I didn&#8217;t really want to announce it because I think talking about funding generally is pretty boring.&#8221; But <a href="https://twitter.com/disclosedtech">disclosure</a> about funding is important &#8211; for transparency, certainly, but also because it helps remind us that the for-profit companies involved with education <a href="https://twitter.com/scholarlykitchn/status/836729249033777153">have other missions</a> besides simply &#8220;improving learning outcomes.&#8221;</p>
