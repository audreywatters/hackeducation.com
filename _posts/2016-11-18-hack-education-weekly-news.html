<p>It&#8217;s all so awful.</p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Trump</strong> and Chief Strategist Pick <strong>Bannon</strong> Disagreed on Foreign Student Policy,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/11/17/trump-and-chief-strategist-pick-bannon-disagreed-foreign-student-policy">says Inside Higher Ed</a>.

I thought that Trump planned on returning <strong>control of K&#8211;12 to states</strong>, and as such, I&#8217;d assumed he&#8217;d pick a higher ed-oriented secretary. But who friggin&#8217; knows.
