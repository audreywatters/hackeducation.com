<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has released his higher education plan. <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/20/jeb-bush-unveils-higher-education-plan-focus-federal-loan-overhaul">Among its features</a>: &#8220;Bush&#8217;s plan would eliminate the federal student loan program in its current form in favor of a new financing structure that is tied to students&#8217; income. Under the plan, the federal government would provide each high school graduate with access to a $50,000 line of credit to pay for college or career training.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, &#8220;The Obama Administration Proposes $2 Billion More In College Aid,&#8221; <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/01/19/463579237/the-obama-administration-proposes-2-billion-more-in-college-aid">NPR reports</a>.

<p>Also in financial aid news: &#8220;The federal government has in recent months made several changes to the application process for federal financial aid, in an effort to make it easier and more straightforward. But one change &#8211; switching from a four-digit PIN for online access to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid to a more standard and secure log-in identification and password &#8211; may be having the opposite effect,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/18/new-id-requirements-federal-aid-may-discourage-some-low-income-students">Inside Higher Ed reports</a>.</p>

Five national accrediting agencies and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation want to file a &#8220;friend of the court&#8221; brief, arguing that the CFPB does not have the authority to compel records from the accrediting agency that oversaw Corinthian Colleges as part of its inquiry into how the accreditation process works (or doesn&#8217;t work as the case may be).</p>
