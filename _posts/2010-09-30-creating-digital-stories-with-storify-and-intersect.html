<p>As a folklorist and a geek, I am very interested in digital storytelling, and I think there's lots of potential for using technology to innovate how we tell stories.</p>
<p>Two startups - both still in beta - have caught my attention recently:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.storify.com">Storify</a></strong> describes itself as a content curation tool for "bloggers, journalists and experts."  Using Storify, you can tell stories with pieces from the social web -- YouTube videos, tweets, Flickr photos.  Storify allows users to search Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, Google and Delicious for a particular topic, then drag-and-drop pieces of content into a storyline.  The stories created with the tool contain links to the original sources, which is something I think could make it useful for not just building digital current events and history projects.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.intersect.com">Intersect</a></strong> is developing what I think is a really interesting tool for sharing stories.  The site allows you to write a story and add up to 25 photos and 1 video.  Simple enough.  What's cool about Intersect is that your stories are tagged with the time and place where the story occurred.  They're plotted on a timeline and a map.  And then you can examine the other public stories that happened there -- in time and/or in space -- as well.</p>
<p>As the sites are in beta, you'll need to request invitations in order to join, but they are both definitely worth checking out.</p>
