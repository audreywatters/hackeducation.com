<p>Last year was the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/10/04/sxsw-interactive-announces-an-education-conference/">very first</a> <a href="http://sxswedu.com/">SXSWedu</a>, an educational conference immediately preceding the very popular <a href="http://sxsw.com">South By Southwest</a> Interactive event in Austin.</p>
<p>The event's back again this year -- March 6-8, 2012.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://panelpicker.sxswedu.com/">Panel Picker</a> for this year's event is now live, giving the Internet community the opportunity to weigh in on which panels they'd like to see.</p>
<p>The conference has also just announced <a href="http://sxswedu.com/launchedu">LAUNCHedu</a>, a competition for ed-tech startups.  It will be similar to the Accelerator programs that happen at both SXSW Interactive and SXSW Music, giving participants at the event a chance to see some ed-tech startups pitch their products.</p>
<p>The competition will have two categories -- K-12 and higher-ed.  There'll be a full day of presentations in these categories, and the 12 finalists will have their pitches judged before a panel of investors, entrepreneurs and educators.</p>
<p>Applications for LAUNCHedu are now open, through December 2, for interested startups.  There's a $175 application fee, and if you're selected to participate, you'll get 2 complementary tickets to SXSWedu.  Eligible startups must have launched with a product in the K-12 or higher ed markets, have users and be seeking seed or early stage investment.</p>
