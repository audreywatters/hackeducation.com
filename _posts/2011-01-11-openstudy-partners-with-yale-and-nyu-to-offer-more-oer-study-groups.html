<p>The social learning network <a href="http://www.openstudy.com">OpenStudy</a> announced today it has <a href="http://blog.openstudy.com/2011/01/11/openstudy-partners-with-open-yale-and-nyu-open-education/">partnered</a> with Open Yale and New York University's Open Education program.  These universities will use OpenStudy to supplement the following online open courses:</p>
<p><strong>Open Yale:</strong> <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/financial-markets/">Financial Markets</a> with Professor Robert Shiller <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/physics/fundamentals-of-physics/">Fundamentals of Physics</a> with Professor Ramamurti Shankar <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/classics/introduction-to-ancient-greek-history/">Introduction to Ancient Greek History</a> with Professor Donald Kagan <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/history-of-art/roman-architecture/">Roman Architecture</a> with Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner</p>
<p><strong>NYU Open Education:</strong> <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/academics/open-education/courses/american-literature.html">American Literature I: From beginnings to the Civil War</a>by Professor Cyrus Patell <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/academics/open-education/courses/nyc-social-history.html">New York City: A Social History</a> by Professor Daniel Walkowitz <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/academics/open-education/courses/intro-sociology.html">Introduction to Sociology</a> by Professor Harvey Molotch <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/academics/open-education/courses/genomes-and-diversity.html">Genomes &amp; Diversity</a> by Dr. Mark L. Siegal</p>
<p>OpenStudy provides study groups so that <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/opencourseware/">opencourseware</a> learners need not learn alone.  The addition of these courses not only expands the list of OpenStudy study groups, but adds new curriculum areas. As many <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/open-educational-resources/">open educational resources</a> seem to favor math and science courses, it's great to see the addition of history, architecture, and literature content.</p>
