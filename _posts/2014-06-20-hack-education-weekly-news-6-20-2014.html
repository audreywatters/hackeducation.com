<h2>Education Politics</h2>
<p><strong>Louisiana</strong> governor (and perhaps presidential candidate?) <strong>Bobby Jindal</strong> <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/bobby-jindal-louisiana-common-core-108022.html">issued orders</a> to withdraw his state from the <strong>Common Core</strong>. But it wasn&rsquo;t a smooth move, as the state Superintendent insists that Jindal <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/18/5822366/bobby-jindal-cant-quit-the-common-core-on-his-own">doesn&rsquo;t have the authority</a> to do so.</p>
<p>Former <strong>Florida</strong> governor (and perhaps presidential candidate?) <strong>Jeb Bush</strong> is a member of the <strong>Aspen Institute&rsquo;s Task Force on &ldquo;Learning and the Internet&rdquo;</strong> which released its <a href="http://csreports.aspeninstitute.org/Task-Force-on-Learning-and-the-Internet/2014/in-the-news/details/0001/Task-Force-In-The-News-Press-Release">recommendations</a> this week. Among those actions: revise <strong>COPPA</strong>, <strong>FERPA</strong>, and <strong>CIPA</strong>. "Put learners at the center." Mmmhmmm.</p>

<p>And in other news from the Republican party, <strong>Arizona</strong>&rsquo;s Superintendent of Public Instruction John Huppenthal <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/06/20/arizonas-public-school-chief.html">has admitted</a> that he was the pseudonymous author of a series of blog posts &ldquo;describing people who receive welfare as &lsquo;lazy pigs.&rsquo; He also compared Planned Parenthood to Nazis, and said the organization is responsible for most abortions among Black people in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just when I thought its education policies couldn&rsquo;t get any more awful, the Obama administration plans to revamp the <strong>Bureau of Indian Education</strong> through <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/06/12/36indian.h33.html?cmp=ENL-EU-NEWS1">a <strong>Race to the Top</strong> like initiative</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>LAUSD</strong> school board has <a href="http://northhollywood.patch.com/groups/schools/p/lausd-school-board-reappoints-ipad-critic-to-oversight-committee703781">reappointed</a> Stuart Magruder. Magruder, an outspoken critic of the district&rsquo;s <strong>iPad</strong> investment, was voted off the panel last month.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-06-04-searching-for-that-1-billion-in-connected-commitments">Edsurge</a> and <a href="http://www.setda.org/2014/06/14/what-educators-need-to-know-about-connected-school-technology-donations/">SETDA</a> are tracking on the corporate commitments to the Obama Administration&rsquo;s <strong>ConnectED</strong> program, which promises billions of dollars of tech products and services for schools.</p>
<p>The US Department of Education is <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-heightens-oversight-corinthian-colleges">increasing its oversight</a> over the for-profit <strong>Corinthian Colleges</strong> over concerns about its marketing and data practices, and now the company says it might <em>gasp</em> <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/corinthian-colleges-warns-shut-24214795">shut down</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for the <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/06/20/lawmakers-fafsa-simplification-legislation-hea-reauthorization-senate-heats">reauthorization of the <strong>Higher Education Act</strong></a>, and there are efforts to make the <strong>FAFSA</strong> process simpler.</p>
<p>The US Department of Education has <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/06/20/white-house-publishes-new-rules-reporting-investigating-sexual-assaults">proposed changes</a> to the <strong>Clery Act</strong> that would require colleges and universities to expand the collection of data relating to sexual violence on campus.</p>
<p>Continuing to demonstrate how much the state of <strong>Kansas</strong> hates learning: a 9 year old Leawood, Kansas boy has had his &ldquo;little free library&rdquo; <a href="http://www.kmbc.com/news/leawood-shuts-down-boys-little-free-library/26552394#!1oYjq">shut down</a> by the city which has deemed the bookcase violates building code &ndash; it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;illegal accessory building,&rdquo; say officials.</p>
<h2>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://edx.org">edX</a></strong> has 6 new members: <strong>Notre Dame</strong>, the <strong>Sorbonne Universities</strong>, <strong>Hong Kong Polytechnic University</strong>, <strong>Birla Institute of Technology and Science</strong>, <strong>Wageningen University,</strong> and <strong>The University of Adelaide</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Udacity</strong> announced a &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2014/06/announcing-nanodegrees-new-type-of.html">nanodegree</a>,&rdquo; a certificate program &ldquo;designed for efficiency: select hands-on courses by industry, a capstone project, and career guidance.&rdquo; The first nanodegree will be <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>-oriented curriculum. (AT&amp;T is also working with Udacity as part of its Georgia Tech master&rsquo;s degree program.)</p>

<p>The winner of the <strong>best lede in education news</strong> this week goes to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/study-of-moocs-suggests-dropping-the-label-dropout/53421">The Chronicle&rsquo;s Avi-Wolfman-Arent</a>&nbsp;making a case for dropping the word "dropout" to describe those who don't complete <strong>MOOCs</strong>:&nbsp;&ldquo;Way back in 1978, Frenchy in <em>Grease</em> was unceremoniously dubbed a beauty-school dropout. But what if she took a MOOC today on midcentury follicular art? Might we call her a beauty-school &lsquo;collector&rsquo;? What about a beauty-school &lsquo;bystander&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Meanwhile on Campus</h2>
<p>&ldquo;This French tech school has no teachers, no books, no tuition &mdash; and it could change everything,&rdquo; <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/13/this-french-tech-school-has-no-teachers-no-books-no-tuition-and-it-could-change-everything/">squees VentureBeat</a>. EVERYTHING!</p>
<p><strong>King&rsquo;s College</strong> in New York <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/kings-college-in-new-york-to-accept-bitcoin">will accept Bitcoin</a> for tuition. Wait, THIS changes everything!</p>
<p><strong>Starbucks</strong> and <strong>Arizona State University</strong> announced an initiative this week that, according to the earliest churnalism, meant free college tuition for the former&rsquo;s students. WAIT THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING! <a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-12/">I look at this story more closely on EML</a>, as this week's "What You Should Know This Week."&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/us/critics-point-to-drawbacks-in-starbucks-tuition-program.html">Turns out</a>, there&rsquo;s some fine print: &ldquo;notably that students could have to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket, and wait months or years before being reimbursed.&rdquo; Also <strong>Pearson</strong>'s involved (it runs parts of ASU Online). So the winners here: probably not Starbucks-employed students.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reactiongifs.us/its-a-trap-star-wars/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/its_a_trap_star_wars.gif" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong> will <a href="http://edtechtimes.com/2014/06/12/new-masters-degree-education-entrepreneurs/">offer</a> a Master&rsquo;s Degree in Education Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><strong>Brewton-Parker College</strong> has been <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/06/20/southern-accreditor-drops-one-college-puts-four-probation">stripped of its accreditation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MIT</strong>&rsquo;s new Early Childhood Cognition Laboratory will <a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/blog/2014/06/19/new-mit-lab/">research your children via a webcam</a>. "If we can run studies online, we can literally test the world,&rdquo; says Laura Schulz, associate professor at MIT&rsquo;s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. Wow. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<h2>Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Google</strong> has released a <a href="http://youtu.be/K26iyyQMp_g">video</a> promoting its new <strong>Classroom</strong> tool. It&rsquo;s <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/google-classroom-wont-affect-institutional-lms-market-yet/">not quite an LMS</a>, but Google Apps for Education fans appear giddy at the prospect nonetheless.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reactiongifs.us/its-a-trap-star-wars/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/its_a_trap_star_wars.gif" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>In other <strong>Google</strong> news, the company has launched <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com.tr/2014/06/made-with-code-an-effort-by-google-to-inspire-girls-to-code.html">Made to Code</a>, an initiative to get girls interested in programming. (Will it actually <em><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html">hire</a></em> women though. That&rsquo;s my question.)</p>
<p><strong>Securly</strong>, which offers web filtering services for schools, now says it will offer <a href="http://www.eschoolnews.com/2014/06/16/securly-launches-student-achievement-analytics/">Student Achievement Analytics</a>, which &ldquo;leverages the power of big-data analysis to give school leadership critical visibility into how students and teachers in their district are really using technology.&rdquo; Because ed-tech as surveillance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reactiongifs.us/its-a-trap-star-wars/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/its_a_trap_star_wars.gif" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The school messaging service <strong>Remind 101</strong> has <a href="http://blog.remind.com/new-name-same-mission/">rebranded</a> to become simply &ldquo;Remind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.edukwest.com/overview-edtech-startups-2014-pearson-catalyst-program/">Via Edukwest</a>, the list of the startups in <strong>Pearson</strong>&rsquo;s latest accelerator program.</p>
<p>Whee: <a href="http://www.moodlenews.com/2014/face-pass-a-facial-recognition-authentication-concept-for-moodle/">proof of concept</a> for facial recognition technology in <strong>Moodle</strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in other LMS news, <strong>Instructure</strong> held its annual developer conference this week, where it&nbsp;<a href="http://www.instructure.com/press-releases/instructure-unveils-technology-suite-to-revolutionize-in-person-learning">unveiled</a> new &ldquo;<a href="http://mikecaulfield.com/2014/06/18/minimally-invasive-assessment-and-the-new-canvas-suite/">minimally invasive</a>&rdquo; assessment tools. E-literate&rsquo;s <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/instructurecon-canvas-different-competition-now/">Phil Hill weighs in</a> on where he thinks the upstart company is positioned now in the larger LMS market.</p>
<p>(Also <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/happy-10th-birthday-e-literate/">happy 10th anniversary to <strong>E-Literate</strong></a>, which remains one of the best ed-tech blogs out there.)</p>
<h2>Funding and Acquisitions</h2>
<p><strong>Pansophic Learning</strong>, the new company run by Ron Packard, the former head of <strong>K12 Inc</strong>, has <a href="https://secure.marketwatch.com/story/safanad-and-ron-packard-founder-of-k12-inc-launch-pansophic-learning-and-acquire-assets-from-k12-to-pursue-global-education-opportunities-2014-06-13">acquired</a> assets from K12 Inc. Nothing to see here move along.</p>
<p>Assessment company <strong>MasteryConnect</strong> has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-06-19-masteryconnect-acquires-student-response-system-socrative-for-5m">acquired</a> the student response system <strong>Socrative</strong> for $5 million.</p>
<p><strong>Bulb</strong>, &ldquo;a publishing tool that lets students and teachers create and share learning resources, projects and portfolios,&rdquo; has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-06-18-bulb-raises-1m-series-a-for-student-publishing-platform">raised</a> $1 million from undisclosed investors.</p>
<p><strong>Symplicity</strong>, which describes itself as a &ldquo;a market leader in enterprise technology and information systems management for higher education, government, and businesses&rdquo; has <a href="http://www.ecampusnews.com/press-releases/technology-providers/symplicity-acquires-experience-connectedu-company/">acquired</a> <strong>Experience</strong>, career services software from <strong>ConnectEDU</strong> (which is now in bankruptcy and selling off its assets).</p>
<p><strong>Galvanize</strong>, which offers tech classes for entrepreneurs, has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-06-18-galvanize-gets-18m-to-support-entrepreneurs-and-tech-skills">raised</a> $18 million from University Ventures Fund.</p>
<p><strong>Careers360</strong>, a Delhi-based career portal, has <a href="http://www.edukwest.com/hedline-indian-career-portal-careers360-raises-angel-round/">raised</a> an undisclosed amount of funding from angel investors.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not an ed-tech venture, but it&rsquo;s worth pointing out the dumbassery nonetheless. <strong>Yo</strong>, a messaging app that just sends the word &ldquo;Yo&rdquo; to your friends, has reportedly <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/06/18/3450334/yo-app-tech-bubble/">raised</a> $1 million. But there is no bubble, there is no bubble, there is no bubble, there is no bubble.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/schools-restraints-seclusions">ProPublica</a> looks at <strong>schools&rsquo; use of restraints and seclusions</strong>. &ldquo;The practices&mdash;which have included pinning uncooperative children facedown on the floor, locking them in dark closets and tying them up with straps, handcuffs, bungee cords or even duct tape&mdash;were used more than 267,000 times nationwide in the 2012 school year.&rdquo;</p>
