<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>President Obama delivered his final State of the Union address Tuesday evening. &#8220;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-13-the-state-of-the-union-s-education">Education</a>&#8221; showed up several times in the speech, including the idea that every students need to learn to &#8220;<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/01/12/462698966/the-president-wants-every-student-to-learn-computer-science-how-would-that-work">write computer code</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Department of Education&#8217;s Inspector General is auditing Western Governors University over the role faculty have in its competency-based programs, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/15/education-departments-inspector-generals-high-stakes-audit-western-governors-u">Inside Higher Ed reports</a>. &#8220;Previous audits from the inspector general have questioned whether some competency-based programs should be classified as correspondence courses.&#8221; (Jonathan Rees has <a href="http://moreorlessbunk.net/technology/with-or-without-you/">more</a> on this story.)</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/265209-oversight-chair-breach-of-education-department-would-dwarf-opm-hack">Via The Hill</a>: &#8220;House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) is warning that a hack on the Department of Education would dwarf last year&#8217;s massive breach at the Office of Personnel Management. &#8216;Almost half of America's records are sitting at the Department of Education,&#8217; Chaffetz said at a Brookings Institution event on Thursday. &#8216;I think ultimately that&#8217;s going to be the largest data breach that we've ever seen in the history of our nation.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Republican presidential candidates had another debate this week, and <a href="http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-education/2016/01/debate-on-guns-in-schools-flares-up-more-movement-at-edmc-another-houghton-mifflin-video-212200">Common Core was a topic</a> (briefly).</p>

Sanders is trying to woo teen voters, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/sanders-launches-website-to-get-out-the-high-school-vote/">according to Wired</a>.</p>

And they did.</p>

<p>California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="http://edsource.org/2016/brown-says-its-time-to-abandon-api-to-judge-schools-performance-essa/93170">says</a> &#8220;it&#8217;s time to abandon API to judge schools&#8217; performance.&#8221; That&#8217;s the Academic Performance Index (and my partner Kin Lane will be relieved that this won&#8217;t come up in future searches for Application Programming Interface).</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p>The Supreme Court <a href="http://wapo.st/1K7kY4K">heard</a> oral arguments in <em>Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association</em> this week. The case challenges public unions&#8217; ability to collect fees from non-members. Court observers seem certain that the ruling will not be in the union&#8217;s favor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.edlawcenter.org/news/archives/national/court-declares-nevada-voucher-law-violates-state-constitution.html">Via the Education Law Center</a>: &#8220;Judge James Wilson of the First Judicial District Court of Nevada (Carson City) has ruled in <em>Lopez v.

Judge Wilson issued a preliminary injunction to prevent the State from implementing the law.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Testing, Testing&#8230;</h3>
