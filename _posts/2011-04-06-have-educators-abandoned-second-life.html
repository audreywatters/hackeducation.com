<p>Despite a strong presence of academics and educational institutions "in world," Second Life hasn't felt too warm and welcoming to educators lately.  In August of last year, Linden Lab <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/08/14/linden-labs-ceo-announces-second-life-teen-to-close/">announced</a> it was closing the Teen Grid, and then in October, it decided to <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/10/05/considering-the-alternatives-as-second-life-scraps-educator-discounts/">scrap</a> the discounted land prices for educational and non-profit organizations.  I've wondered <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/10/05/considering-the-alternatives-as-second-life-scraps-educator-discounts/">here before</a> if these sorts of decisions would spur folks to relocate their projects to other virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Joe Essid has been asking the same question, and today in <a href="http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2011/04/survey-slow-erosion-of-educators-from-second-life-to-opensim/">Hypergrid Business</a> he's published the results from a survey of educators from the <a href="http://www.sl-educationblog.org/">SLED</a> and <a href="http://www.educause.edu/groups/VW">EDUCAUSE Virtual Worlds</a> lists to see if, indeed, they've moved elsewhere.   And despite what I had predicted, he found no mass exodus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essid notes that his survey was hard to design to capture such a thing, in no small part because of the two-year pricing that Linden Lab had offered to schools and non-profits that might have made it difficult for folks mid-project to relocate.</p>
<p>Roughly 15% of those surveyed said they would own more land in the future, and 23% said they would own less.  If anything, that makes it a "slow erosion of the user base" -- something that could describe the whole Second Life experiment, frankly, not just the educational sector.</p>
<p>As Essid notes, it's not really an either-or proposition.  Groups can own land in Second Life while renting server space for an OpenSim installation.  And that might be what's happening as the survey found more people trying out non-Second Life options.</p>
<p>As always:  I'd love to talk to educators who are working with virtual worlds.  How are you handling this uncertainty with Linden Lab (whether perceived or real)?</p>
