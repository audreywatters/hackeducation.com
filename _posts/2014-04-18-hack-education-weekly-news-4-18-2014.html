<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>60 years after <strong><em>Brown v Board of Education</em></strong>, <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/segregation-now-the-resegregation-of-americas-schools#intro">ProPublica&rsquo;s Nikole Hannah-Jones</a> examines the <strong>re-segregation</strong> of US schools.</p>
<p>The <strong>Florida</strong> House of Representatives has <a href="http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Florida-Senate-Passes-Student-Data-Privacy-Bill-252513181.html">passed legislation</a> that would protect <strong>student privacy</strong>, phasing out the usage of Social Security numbers as student IDs and banning biometric data collection. (I guess this only applies to school districts in the state though. I imagine MOOC providers will still be able to do so, right?)</p>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Education</strong> has put out <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/04/how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">an RFI</a> (Request for Information) about how it could &ldquo;use <strong>APIs</strong> to increase access to higher education data or financial aid programs.&rdquo; So guess what we&rsquo;ve been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com">here at my house</a> this week, eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <strong>Maryland</strong> Higher Education Commission is cracking down on institutions that provide <strong>distance education</strong> to students in the state,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/04/16/armed-federal-data-maryland-goes-after-out-state-distance-education-providers">reports Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Virginia</strong> Supreme Court has <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/04/18/virginias-high-court-protects-privacy-researchers-emails">ruled</a> that a UVA climate scientist&rsquo;s emails were protected and exempt from public records requests. An anti-climate change organization had sought the researcher&rsquo;s emails, &ldquo;hoping that exchanges among climate scientists might cast doubt on views of the environment backed by most scholars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Huffington Post <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/16/sallie-mae-servicemembers_n_5162736.html?1397693462">reports</a> that <strong>Sallie Mae</strong> has &ldquo;cheated active-duty soldiers on federal student loan,&rdquo; according to sources close to the federal investigation into the company.</p>
<p>The online for-profit school <strong>K12 Inc</strong> is being <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/04/investor_lawsuit_targets_k12_inc_and_stock_sales_of_former_ceo.html">sued</a> for misleading investors &ldquo;by putting forward overly positive public statements during much of last year, only later to reveal that it had missed key operational and financial targets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New York Times examines <strong>libraries</strong>&rsquo; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/technology/libraries-seek-high-speed-broadband.html">push</a> for more <strong>high speed broadband</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Nigeria</strong>, some 129 girls were <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27049803">abducted</a> from their school by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram which opposes Western education. There are conflicting reports about whether or not the girls have been freed.</p>
<h2>Here&rsquo;s How NOT to Address Bullying in Schools</h2>
<p>A <strong>Pennsylvania</strong> special education student, unable to get help from his school to stop fellow students from bullying him, tape-recorded one of his tormenters. He&rsquo;s now being charged with <a href="http://aattp.org/special-ed-student-who-recorded-bullies-tormenting-him-accused-of-felony-wiretapping/">felony wiretapping</a>.</p>
<p>The fifth graders at Zeman Elementary School in <strong>Nebraska</strong> were sent home <a href="http://jezebel.com/nebraska-school-gives-most-idiotic-advice-ever-to-deal-1564016234">a guide on how to handle bullies</a>: Rule #7: Do not tell on them.</p>
<h2>MOOCs: Free as in "Bullshit"</h2>
<p><strong>Udacity</strong> <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2014/04/phasing-out-certificates-of-free16.html">announced</a> this week that it would phase out free certificates for those who successfully complete its classes because students demanded more rigor. For reals?! No specifics on how much the startup is going to charge for the certificates now &ndash; Sebastian Thrun says &ldquo;a relatively modest tuition fee.&rdquo; Currently Udacity charges $150 a month for a mentor and feedback. MOOCs: free as in &ldquo;bullshit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New York Times <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/education/out-in-front-and-optimistic-about-online-education.html">interviews</a> the new <strong>Coursera</strong> CEO, former Yale president Richard Levin. Levin says that &ldquo;I think we can become financially viable certainly within that five-year framework.&rdquo; Good luck with that, particularly <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/coursera-ceo-interview-mike-caulfield-nailed-two-months-ago/">as Mike Caulfield notes</a>, you&rsquo;re not really being honest about why other online initiatives you were involved with in the past failed.</p>
<p><strong>edX</strong> is <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/04/17/edx-taps-coursetalk-for-online-course-reviews.aspx">teaming up</a> with <strong>Coursetalk</strong>, a service that lets reviewers rate MOOC courses. &ldquo;Four stars: would enroll but never actually click on anything again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fan-created <strong>Harry Potter</strong> MOOC now, and <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/04/14/hogwarts_is_here_is_like_a_mooc_for_harry_potter_fans_and_you_can_enroll.html">Slate says</a> &ldquo;the curriculum itself is surprisingly rigorous.&rdquo; Hey guys, remember when Sebastian Thrun said Udacity had found the "<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/software/udacity-ceo-says-mooc-magic-formula-emerging/d/d-id/1111221">magic formula</a>" to make MOOCs work? Maybe he was just foreseeing the Harry Potter MOOC.</p>
<h2>Meanwhile&hellip; on Campus</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/confessions-of-an-ivy-league-frat-boy-inside-dartmouths-hazing-abuses-20120328"><strong>Dartmouth</strong> is terrible</a>. Really terrible.</p>

<p>The <strong>Mid-Continent University</strong> in <strong>Kentucky</strong> has <a href="http://www.parispi.net/news/local_news/article_e022b5b2-c585-11e3-ac7f-001a4bcf887a.html">laid off</a> all its faculty and staff and will close its doors by June 30.</p>

Well, the university saw a 20% drop in applications, if that&rsquo;s any indication.</p>
<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p>Online learning pioneer <strong>Tony Bates</strong> has announced his retirement in <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2014/04/15/time-to-retire-from-online-learning/">this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;must read&rdquo; blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am concerned that the computer scientists seem to be taking over online education. Ivy League MOOCs are being driven mainly by computer scientists, not educators. Politicians are looking to computer science to automate learning in order to save money. Computer scientists have much to offer, but they need more humility and a greater willingness to work with other professionals, such as psychologists and teachers, who understand better how learning operates. This is a battle that has always existed in educational technology, but it&rsquo;s one I fear the educators are losing. The result could be disastrous.</p>
