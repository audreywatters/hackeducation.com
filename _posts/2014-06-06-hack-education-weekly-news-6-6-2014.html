Any guesses about why? Hmmm.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/senior-prank-arrests.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>No charges have been filed against the <strong>Santa Barbara</strong> High School students whose senior prank involved <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-barbara-mariachi-senior-prank-20140604-story.html">hiring a mariachi band to follow their principal</a> around.</p>

<h2>Dangers on the Conference Circuit</h2>
<p>Ariel Norling has taken down a blog post she published on Friday, detailing predatory behavior and sexual assault at last year&rsquo;s <strong>ISTE</strong> conference. It&rsquo;s been pretty goddamn awful to watch the fall out from this: personal attacks, refusal to take responsibility, silencing tactics, and a focus on individual actions rather than on the larger cultural and institutional issues &ndash; all from folks who describe themselves as leaders in ed-tech. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/06/04/yesallwomen-iste-code-of-conduct/">Please join me</a> in demanding that ISTE (and other conferences) adopt <a href="http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq">a <strong>Code of Conduct</strong> that explicitly addresses <strong>harassment</strong></a>.</p>
<p>See, while certainly violence at tech events is something we need to stop, there are actually a wide range of hostile behaviors that make these events unsafe and unwelcoming. <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/06/04/318882549/women-complain-a-lot-interrupt-developer-says-at-conference">Here&rsquo;s the latest example</a>.</p>
