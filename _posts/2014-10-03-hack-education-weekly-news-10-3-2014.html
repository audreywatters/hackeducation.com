<h2>Student Protests</h2>
<p>This week marks the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/us/free-though-subdued-speech-50-years-later.html">50th anniversary</a> of the arrest of Jack Weinberg for distributing leaflets about the civil rights movement on the campus of the <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong>. Weinberg sat in the back of a police car for over 32 hours while thousands of students gathered around it, blocking it from moving and from taking him to jail. Students used the car as a podium to protest the restriction of free speech on campus. This was the birth of the <strong>Free Speech Movement</strong>.</p>
<p>In this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-27/">What You Should Know This Week</a>&rdquo; over on Educating Modern Learners, I look at student protests at <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2014/10/01/students-occupy-campus-building-50th-anniversary-free-speech-movement/"><strong>UC Berkeley</strong></a>, in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29457900"><strong>Hong Kong</strong></a>, and in the <a href="http://co.chalkbeat.org/2014/09/30/jeffcos-latino-students-u-s-history-debate-could-coast-them-a-chance-to-get-ahead/"><strong>Jefferson County Public School District</strong> in <strong>Colorado</strong></a>. (I did not cover the protests over <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/09/29/brigham-young-students-protest-beard-ban">the beard ban</a> at <strong>BYU</strong> or the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/09/29/colgate-reaches-deal-end-sit">recent sit-in</a> at <strong>Colgate University</strong>.)</p>
<h2>Elsewhere in Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p>Despite student and teacher protests, the <strong>Jefferson County</strong> school board is <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/5638f9e60740470db9db30b204b33a1a/history-fight-coming-head-suburban-denver">moving forward</a> with its plans to review the <strong>AP History</strong> course to make sure students learn all about the proud US tradition of compliance.</p>
<p>The CEO and three employees of the for-profit <strong>FastTrain College</strong> were indicted this week, <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article2485300.html">charged</a> &ldquo;with one count of conspiracy and multiple counts of theft of government money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lots of muttering and grumbling but few clear statements from <strong>LAUSD</strong> about the future of <strong>Superintendent John Deasy</strong>. It does appears as though the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-deasy-lausd-20141002-story.html">school board</a> will begin talks on what his departure might look like.</p>
<p>And speaking of <strong>LAUSD</strong>, the district has <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/10/01/06brief-8.h34.html">paid</a> $3.75 million to settle a lawsuit with Maximus Inc, the company hired to build its new <strong>student information system</strong>. The district spent $112 million to build the system but never implemented it.</p>

Brown also signed <a href="http://sd06.senate.ca.gov/sites/sd06.senate.ca.gov/files/SOPIPA%20fact%20sheet.pdf">the <strong>Student Online Personal Information Protection Act</strong></a>, improving some of aspects of student privacy in the state, as well as a <a href="http://communitycollegespotlight.org/content/california-oks-4-year-degrees-2-year-colleges-2_18018/">bill</a> that allows some 2 year colleges in the state to offer 4 year degrees. He <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/149057/">also signed a law</a> that &ldquo;that explicitly requires colleges and universities that receive state funds to define consent in students&rsquo; sexual encounters in terms of &lsquo;<strong>yes means yes</strong>&rsquo; rather than the traditional &lsquo;no means no.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
