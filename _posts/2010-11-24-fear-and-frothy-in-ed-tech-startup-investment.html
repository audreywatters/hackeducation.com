<p>There's been a lot of talk recently that the tech industry may be experiencing another bubble, as we're seeing a flood of big investments in a lot of Internet companies, often at what seem like rather high valuations. Venture capitalist Fred Wilson won't use the word "bubble," but he did recently point to "<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/11/storm-clouds.html">storm clouds</a>" in the industry, suggesting that "the competition for 'hot' deals is making people crazy and I am seeing many more unnatural acts from investors happening. If it were just valuations rising quickly, I'd be a bit less concerned. But we are also seeing large deals ($5mm to $15mm) getting done in a few days with little or no due diligence. Investors are showing up at the first meeting with term sheets."</p>
<p>It isn't sustainable.</p>
<p>As a tech journalist, I pay attention to these trends on an industry level. It's my job.  And I won't lie, I've reacted to a couple of recent high profile investments lately with a furrowed, confused look, muttering "This can't end well."  But hey, what do I know?  I studied folklore not finance in graduate school.</p>
<p>Regardless (or perhaps because) of my academic training, my interest in investment -- bubbles and otherwise -- in the education space is different than my attention to other areas.  I want to see investment dollars flow.  I want to see innovation.  I want to see some of the smart entrepreneurs I meet and talk to funded.  It's not simply because I root for (ed) tech startups (which I do).  I root for education, I root for educators, and at the end of the day and the most important thing of all, I root for students.</p>
<p>So I worry about, to use Wilson's terms, "unnatural acts from investors" playing out badly in education technology.  I worry that education may be "hot" but that investments may not be "smart."  Granted, I am not concerned so much about the fallout from burst bubbles on the pocketbooks of investors (my apologies to all involved).  But I worry that "bad investments" might be blamed on the education industry and not on the tech industry part of the equation.  I worry that investors will again be wary of backing ed-tech projects.  I worry that education just won't seem like a worthwhile place for investment.  I worry people will stop paying attention.</p>
<p>And then again, I worry that certain people <em>are</em> paying attention.  I worry that certain folks <em>are</em> investing. I look at a <a href="http://www.learnboost.com/wireless-generation-acquisition-news-corp/">$360 million acquisition</a> for Wireless Generation -- a company that handles student information systems and played a part in the development of the personalized learning <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/community/innovation/SchoolofOne/default.htm">School of One</a> technology -- by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and I want to shout "This can't end well."</p>
<p>Different "storm clouds" altogether.</p>
