<p>Every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>Well, it's actually been 2 weeks since we've recorded an episode, what with busy travel schedules, unreliable WiFi in various travel locations, and so on. But we finally had a chance yesterday to talk our way through several weeks' worth of Hack Education stories and educational news items. Among other things, we discuss textbooks, hackathons, and MOOCs. We also explore the downsides of framing education "reform" in terms of warfare, market opportunities, or (race to the top) competitions.&nbsp;</p>
