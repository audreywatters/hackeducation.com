<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p>The US Department of Justice has<a href="http://mfeldstein.com/ed-tech-world-on-notice-miami-u-disability-discrimination-lawsuit-could-have-major-effect/"> joined a lawsuit</a> by a student at Miami University in Ohio that charges the university has violated the ADA by adopting education technologies that are inaccessible to the disabled. The software listed in the suit includes the university&#8217;s websites, YouTube, Vimeo, TurnItIn, Google Docs, and more. </p>

<h3>Testing, Testing&#8230;</h3>
<br />

<p>&#8220;Testing company Pearson – slated to run Indiana&#8217;s statewide ISTEP+ tests beginning in 2016 – is facing criticism over security of assessments it handles in other states,&#8221; <a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/stateimpact/2015/05/14/indianas-test-vendor-finds-hot-water/">Indiana Public Media reports</a>. (Indiana has chosen to ditch its current testing provider CTB-McGraw Hill to go with Pearson. LOL. Good luck with that!)</p>

<h3>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h3>
<br />
<p>FutureLearn has signed a deal with Pearson to have the education giant handle <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/mooc-test-agreement-between-futurelearn-and-pearson/2020145.article">administration of its MOOC tests</a>. I mean, if it&#8217;s good enough for the Common Core tests, it&#8217;s gotta be good enough for MOOCs. Right?</p>

<p>edX is teaming up with Qualcomm, and according to the <a href="http://www.ecampusnews.com/top-news/edx-qualcomm-mobile-048/">marketingspeak</a> it&#8217;s &#8220;a collaboration aimed at further developing edX&#8217;s MOOC mobile capabilities and enhance its open source platform to benefit connected learners around the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>HarvardX&#8217;s Justin Reich reports from China, &#8220;<a href="http://www.edtechresearcher.com/2015/05/moocs-in-china/">where everything is a MOOC</a>.&#8221; (And <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/edutech/edtech-and-mooc-times-china">here&#8217;s the report from the World Bank&#8217;s Michael Trucano</a> on the same event.)</p>

<p>FutureLearn, bless its heart, boasts that it has the MOOC with a record number of students: &#8220;FutureLearn says it has 370,000 students enrolled for a British Council course preparing for an English language test,&#8221; <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/education-32721056">the BBC dutifully reports</a>.</p>
