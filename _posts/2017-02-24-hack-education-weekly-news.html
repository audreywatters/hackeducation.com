<p><a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/calthomas/2017/02/16/interview-of-secretary-of-education-betsy-devos-n2286164">An interview with <strong>Betsy DeVos</strong> in Townhall</a>. The highlight:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I visited a school on Friday and met with some wonderful, genuine, sincere teachers who pour their heart and soul into their classrooms and their students and our conversation was not long enough to draw out of them what is limiting them from being even more success from what they are currently. But I can tell the attitude is more of a &#8216;<strong>receive mode</strong>.&#8217; They&#8217;re waiting to be told what they have to do, and that&#8217;s not going to bring success to an individual child. You have to have teachers who are empowered to facilitate great teaching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the response from those teachers, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/02/18/devos-criticized-teachers-at-d-c-school-she-visited-and-they-are-not-having-it/?utm_term=.82072e956256">via The Washington Post</a>: &#8220;DeVos criticized teachers at <strong>D.C.</strong> school she visited &#8211; and they are not having it.&#8221;</p>
