<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-03-24-teachers-ideas-and-mark-cuban-adapting-shark-tanks-in-your-school">Edsurge writes</a> about how schools can bring &#8220;Shark Tanks&#8221; to their schools. <em>Shark Tank</em> is a reality TV show featuring investor Mark Cuban in which entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to a panel of judges, hoping to win some investment. &#8220;Shark Tank funds fewer women than men, with less money,&#8221; <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/01/15/shark-tank-women-entrepreneurs/#E5ynalBFJkqI">Mashable wrote</a> earlier this year, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be totally equitable if schools adopt the practice.</p>
