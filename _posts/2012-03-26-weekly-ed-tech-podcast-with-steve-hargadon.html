<p>Every week,&nbsp;<a href="http://stevehargadon.com/">Steve Hargadon</a>&nbsp;and I sit down (virtually) to talk about the latest ed-tech news. I always find our conversation to be one of the most thought-provoking exchanges I have all week.</p>
<p>We actually missed our weekly podcast last week, thanks to the demands of our travel/conferences schedules. &nbsp;But we were back on track this week, covering 14+ days of ed-tech happenings. &nbsp;There were also some technical problems with this week's recording -- ugh, Skype. &nbsp;But Steve was able to correct the issue, demonstrating one might argue that podcasting software is not a MacGuffin.</p>
<p>Yes, we talk a lot about <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/ed-tech-macguffin">MacGuffins</a> in this week's episode, among other things. &nbsp;The link to the MP3 is below, and/or you can subscribe to the podcast feed&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/edtechlive/hackeducation">here</a>. &nbsp;You can also find the podcast in iTunes, as part of Steve's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/edtechlive/id219875737">EdTechLive series</a>.</p>
