<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>WTF, Wisconsin. First, it was the $300 million slashed from the budget for public higher ed.

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/06/05/ny-sues-company-allegedly-duping-nursing-students">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &#8220;New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman on Thursday announced a lawsuit against the College Network, an Indiana company. The suit charges that the company duped students in the state into thinking that the College Network had an affiliation with Excelsior College and then selling various services that were in theory designed to help with Excelsior programs. But the services were unrelated to Excelsior, and the College Network&#8217;s products did nothing to prepare students for Excelsior exams, the suit says.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Testing, Testing&#8230;</h3>

It eliminates $4.2 million the education department needed to pay Smarter Balanced for next year&#8217;s tests.&#8221;</p>

Teachers and principals used it more often, but a 2012 audit report by the city comptroller found that nearly half of them had not logged into the system during the previous year.</p>
