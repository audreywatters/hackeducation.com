<p>Last week marked the ninth anniversary of Hack Education. It seems a little strange to even make note of the occasion as it&#8217;s been almost six months since I&#8217;ve written anything here.</p>

<p>I finally completed the draft of <em>Teaching Machines</em> on 31 May. It still needs some work &#8211; some editing, some peer review, some image permissions, and such &#8211; but I&#8217;m pretty pleased with how it&#8217;s come together. It&#8217;s not at all the book that I initially imagined I&#8217;d write when I first thought, so many years ago now, that I&#8217;d look at the long history of attempts to automate education.</p>

<p>In order to write the book, I put a lot of the work I&#8217;d regularly done on this website &#8220;on pause&#8221; &#8211; the weekly round-up of education news, the newsletter, the end-of-year &#8220;trends&#8221; articles. And all along the way, I have been thinking a lot about what exactly I plan to do here when <em>Teaching Machines</em> is done. I don&#8217;t really have a good answer yet.</p>

<p>As it currently stands, I do not plan on resuming the weekly round-up I&#8217;d write every Friday; and as such, I don&#8217;t think the year-end articles will continue either &#8211; at least not in the (long) form they&#8217;ve long taken. I will, however, start writing HEWN again. (Soon.) </p>

<p>And I will write articles here on Hack Education &#8211; I have a lot of ideas and stories to tell. But what I refuse to do is pay quite such close attention to the day-to-day bullshit of the ed-tech industry &#8211; or, more broadly, to the day-to-day bullshit of social media. I really can&#8217;t tell you how much happier I am &#8211; despite all the stress of researching and writing a book &#8211; by being offline and tuned out.</p>

<p>I can promise you, ed-tech is not changing faster than it&#8217;s ever changed before. The people who want you to think that are hoping that they can wind you up and spin you &#8217;round and knock you off center so that you&#8217;ll be less able to stand firm and resist their &#8220;disruption.&#8221; </p>
