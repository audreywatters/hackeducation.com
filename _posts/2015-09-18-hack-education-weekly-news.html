<p>Jared Keller on Ahmed Mohamed's experiences and &#8220;<a href="http://www.psmag.com/politics-and-law/the-criminalization-of-the-american-schoolyard">The Criminalization of the American Schoolyard</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The simple facts of the case surrounding the 14-year-old student&#8217;s arrest are infuriating. [Ahmed] Mohamed, a ninth-grader at Irving MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas, loved to tinker with electronics. One evening, he built a clock from circuit boards and wiring, which he stashed in a pencil case. On Tuesday, he showed his creation to his teachers. His engineering instructor praised the design; the English teacher thought it was a bomb. Mohamed was handcuffed by police officers and interrogated for hours. No charges were filed.</p>

<p>The outpouring of support for Ahmed Mohamed was truly wonderful to see. But I think it's important that we call out the injustice of the school-to-prison pipeline as it affects <em>all</em> students, particularly students of color, not just those students who are science whizzes.</p>
