<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>&#8220;Every few weeks, it seems, a new investigation is launched into one of the larger for-profit colleges in the country,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/10/12/federal-agencies-join-forces-regulate-profit-colleges">Inside Higher Ed reports</a>. And yet&#8230; And yet: the US Department of Education just announced it will allow <a href="http://blog.ed.gov/2015/10/educational-quality-through-innovative-partnerships-equip-expanding-access-to-high-quality-innovative-postsecondary-education/">federal financial aid</a> to be used for &#8220;alternative education providers,&#8221; including MOOCs and coding bootcamps. Although the Obama Administration has cracked down on for-profit universities, it seems more than happy to fund a new revenue stream for for-profits: the outsourcing of instruction to tech startups. Ted Mitchell, Under Secretary of Education and former venture capitalist at New School Venture Fund, announced the pilot program. <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-10-14-us-department-of-education-opens-financial-aid-to-students-in-bootcamps-and-non-institutional-programs">More via Edsurge</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/for-profit-colleges-accused-of-fraud-still-receive-us-funds.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">as The New York Times observes</a>, &#8220;For-Profit Colleges Accused of Fraud Still Receive U.S. Funds.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is seeking information from a national accreditor about the for-profit colleges it oversees, which include several controversial chains,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/10/15/federal-watchdog-seeks-information-national-accreditor-about-profit-colleges">writes Inside Higher Ed</a>. &#8220;The Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools received the civil investigative demand from the CFPB in August. It is unclear whether the council, which is the largest national accreditor, is the target of an investigation, or whether the request is linked to another probe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The US Department of Education <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-10-09-white-house-to-fight-chronic-absenteeism-with-data">announced</a> it will publish data on chronic absenteeism in schools, according to Edsurge, &#8220;in hopes of giving them the insights (and the public shaming) to do something about it.&#8221;</p>
