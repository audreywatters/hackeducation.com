<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p><strong>LAUSD</strong>&rsquo;s new superintendent Ramon Cortines <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ipad-bonds-20141023-story.html">says</a> that construction bonds shouldn&rsquo;t pay for <strong>iPads</strong> and <strong>Pearson</strong> curriculum. Currently, construction bonds are paying for the district&rsquo;s iPads and Pearson curriculum. So the LAUSD iPad saga continues&hellip;</p>
<p>Barbara Byrd-Bennett, the head of <strong>Chicago Public Schools</strong>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/10/23/just-when-things-were-looking-bad-for-parcc-they-got-worse/">says</a> she wants to delay the use of <strong>PARCC</strong> Common Core tests in her district. The state of Illinois plans to do so, so I&rsquo;m not sure how all of this will play out as the state has already decreed that the city cannot opt out of the PARCC assessments.</p>
<p><strong>NYC</strong> Schools Chancellor Carmen Fari&ntilde;a &ldquo;swapped 15 of 42 city school superintendents, or nearly 36%, in her biggest personnel shakeup since taking office,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/exclusive-schools-chancellor-dumps-36-superintendents-article-1.1981379">says the NY Daily News</a>. &ldquo;Swapped&rdquo; is an interesting verb. &ldquo;Must reapply for their jobs&rdquo; is a better description.</p>
<p>Common Pleas Court Judge Nina Wright Padilla <a href="http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/-Judge-Grants-Injunction-for-Philly-Teachers-District-Unable-to-Move-Forward-With-Healthcare-Changes--279818122.html">issued</a> a preliminary injunction, stopping the <strong>Philadelphia</strong> school district from changing its teacher contract so that teachers would have to pay their own health care costs.</p>
<p>The US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit has overturned a lower court&rsquo;s ruling in <em>Cambridge v Patton</em>, an important <strong>copyright/fair use case</strong> involving Georgia State University and university e-reserves.

Most of the staff who work in the cafeteria are native Spanish speakers, and 86% of the students at the school identify as Hispanic. The school says that the workers have misconstrued the rule; it&rsquo;s only <strong>English-only</strong> while &ldquo;performing job duties.&rdquo; Oh.</p>

But hey.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/10/22/u-arkansas-system-debates-how-fund-online-education-startup">Via Inside Higher Ed</a>: &ldquo;The <strong>University of Arkansas</strong> System in March approved the creation of a fully online institution that would spring from the system&rsquo;s pool of talent and resources.

<h2>Meanwhile on Campus</h2>

The students were rioting over the&hellip; pumpkin festival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <strong>Boston Public Schools</strong> is considering the development of a policy to add another layer of security to help protect students and staff. This would involve training School Police Officers in the use of OC spray, also known as <strong>pepper spray</strong>, and equipping officers with this tool.&rdquo; So you should probably show up at the <a href="http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/site/Default.aspx?PageID=2&amp;PageType=17&amp;DomainID=4&amp;ModuleInstanceID=1&amp;EventDateID=1377&amp;CurrentView=month">public forum</a> to discuss this, Boston edu people.</p>

<h2>Go, School Sports Team!</h2>
<p>Holy crap, <strong>Tar Heels</strong>. I mean, yeah, I think many of us recognize that lots of shady things happen to maintain student athletes&rsquo; eligibility. But this week, a 1367-page report was released detaining 18 years worth of <strong>academic fraud</strong>, supported by professors, coaches, and administrators at the <strong>University of North Carolina</strong>. &ldquo;The report estimates that more than 3,100 students received &rdquo;irregular instruction&ldquo; in the department&rsquo;s &rdquo;paper classes,&ldquo; which did not meet and required only a single paper for credit. Student athletes were disproportionately represented in the classes, accounting for 47.6 percent of enrollments, while making up just 4 percent of the undergraduate student body.&rdquo; More <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Widespread-Nature-of-Chapel/149603/">here</a> and <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/3-key-findings-in-chapel-hills-academic-fraud-investigation/88325">here</a> and <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Key-Players-in-Academic-Fraud/149583/">here</a> in The Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>
<p>A new lawsuit was filed this week, charging <strong>NCAA</strong> and Division 1 schools of violating the wage-and-hour provisions of the <strong>Fair Labor Standards Act</strong>. More <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2014/10/23/ncaa-class-action-lawsuit-obannon-case/17790847/">via USA Today</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <strong>University of Texas</strong> could spend nearly $6 million a year to comply with a string of recent legal rulings requiring colleges to be more generous to their scholarship athletes.&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/college-sports/headlines/20141021-texas-athletic-director-with-new-rules-longhorns-will-pay-each-player-10000.ece">That&rsquo;s about $10,000 per player</a>.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly a quarter of respondents to a new survey of <strong>NCAA</strong> colleges said their institutions do not have a formal process for educating athletes about the danger of head injuries,&rdquo; <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/149545/">reports The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>. The NCAA does require colleges have a &ldquo;<strong>concussion</strong> management plan,&rdquo; but there&rsquo;s no penalty if you don&rsquo;t. So ya know, whatever.</p>
<p>The coaches at Sayreville High School in <strong>New Jersey</strong> have been <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/11741985/sayreville-coaches-suspended-school-board-meeting">suspended</a>, following sexual assault charges filed against several of the school&rsquo;s football players <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2014/10/17/hack-education-weekly-news-10-17-2014/">last week</a>.</p>

<p>A <strong>Tennessee</strong> school district has <a href="http://3dprint.com/19582/tech-fired-over-3dpaintballgun/">fired</a> one of its IT staff after he used a school <strong>3D printer</strong> &ldquo;to create an inoperable part of a paintball gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some folks are up-in-arms because of the <a href="http://time.com/3533556/the-war-on-teacher-tenure/?pcd=hp-magmod">cover story</a> in the November 3 issue of <strong>Time Magazine</strong> on <strong>teacher tenure</strong>. The cover itself is not quite as provocative as the 2008 one with Michelle Rhee holding the broom ready to sweep the classrooms of DC &ldquo;clean,&rdquo; but this one features the phrase &ldquo;rotten apples&rdquo; with a gavel preparing to smash a perfectly nice looking piece of fruit. AFT&rsquo;s Randi Weingarten is demanding the magazine apologize to teachers, and there&rsquo;s been lots of discussion on Twitter today about the article. Time is probably relieved there&rsquo;s a controversy so that people actually read the damn magazine.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to see coverage of <strong>video games</strong> made by teenage girls, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. But in the midst of #gamergate, with all the hatred that&rsquo;s being unleashed on women in the industry, it&rsquo;s probably not the best timing for <a href="http://mic.com/articles/100672/two-teenage-girls-have-invented-the-most-powerful-video-game-of-the-year">Mic&rsquo;s story</a> about two teens and their video game Tampon Run.

<p>Earlier this month, I <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/status/518196788486864898">tweeted a question</a>, asking what the education equivalent is of the &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/status/518196788486864898">Paypal Mafia</a>.&rdquo; <a href="http://inthecapital.streetwise.co/2014/10/17/behind-the-chalk-the-blackboard-mafia/">InTheCapital just ran a story</a>, with supporting anecdotes provided by <strong>Blackboard</strong> execs, claiming it&rsquo;s Blackboard.
