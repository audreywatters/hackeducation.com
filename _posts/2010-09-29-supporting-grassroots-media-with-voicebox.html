<p>Have I mentioned lately how much I like <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>?  Oh yes, <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/09/29/teach-gov-another-federal-website-in-drupal/">yes I have</a>.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I like Drupal is its strong developer community.  And sure, you can say that about a lot of open source.  But some of the projects undertaken by Drupal I find real affinity with -- not just technologically, but politically as well (if that makes sense).</p>
<p>And one of those is <a href="http://code.funnymonkey.com/">VoiceBox</a>, available for download today.</p>
<p>VoiceBox was built as part of the Knight Drupal Initiative and funded by the <a href="http://www.knightblog.org/knight-drupal-initiative-announces-six-winners">Knight Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>VoiceBox is designed to be a tool for grassroots and community media.  As users on a VoiceBox/Drupal site create content, they generate their own blog.  Out-of-the-box, VoiceBox offers customizable user profiles, content creation (text, videos, photos), content aggregation (via RSS), as well as discussion.</p>
<p>VoiceBox allows the creation of a Drupal site that is geared towards community participation, offering not just the tools to create content, but to curate content as well -- and arguably, the latter is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p>The educational applications are numerous -- school newspapers, local writing projects -- which shouldn't be a surprise since VoiceBox was developed by the good folks at <a href="http://www.funnymonkey.com/">FunnyMonkey</a>.</p>
