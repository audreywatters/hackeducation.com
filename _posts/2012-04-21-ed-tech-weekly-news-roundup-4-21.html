<h2 id="educationsdavos">Education&rsquo;s Davos?</h2>
<p>Some 800 investors, entrepreneurs, and politicians met at ASU Skysong this week for the <a href="http://edinnovation.asu.edu/"><strong>Education Innovation Summit</strong></a>. That Innosight Institute&rsquo;s Michael Horn called it &ldquo;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhorn/2012/04/19/education-innovation-heats-up-in-the-deser">Davos in the Desert</a>&rdquo; speaks volumes I think: the political and economic elite gather to discuss &ldquo;problems&rdquo; that they can resolve neatly and profitably. I&rsquo;ve tried all week to figure out how respond to what I saw on my Tweet stream coming out of the event: a call to fire teachers to pay for more technology, calling education &ldquo;war,&rdquo; wishing universities be more like corporations. I <a href="http://storify.com/audreywatters/how-do-you-define-innovation-an-eisummit-dictionar">storified</a> <a href="http://storify.com/audreywatters/what-counts-as-innovation-in-education">some of the Tweets</a>, but really I recommend <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2012/04/19/remaking-education-in-the-image-of-our-desires/">George Siemens&rsquo; analysis</a>.</p>
<h2 id="politicspoliciesandpepper-spray">Politics, Policies, and Pepper-spray</h2>
<p>The title of <a href="http://bradhicks.livejournal.com/459368.html">Brad Hicks&rsquo; blog post</a> says it all: &ldquo;Sometimes, When &lsquo;All the Facts are In,&rsquo; It&rsquo;s Worse: The <strong>UC-Davis Pepper-Spray</strong> Report.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="legalities">Legalities</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court will hear a case that could have sweeping impact on what&rsquo;s known as the &ldquo;<strong>first sale doctrine</strong>.&rdquo; The case, <em>Supap Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons</em>, involves buying textbooks overseas and reselling them here in the US Writing for <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/131568">The Chronicle</a>, Jen Howard argues that "the case has the potential to affect many categories of copyrighted work. In a blog post on Monday, the advocacy group Public Knowledge wrote: &lsquo;This ruling could cripple markets for used books, movies, CD&rsquo;s, toys, and any other goods that contain copyrighted works. For example, many cars contain copyrighted computer programs, so used-car sales for foreign-manufactured would become illegal (without the copyright owner&rsquo;s permission).&rsquo;</p>
<h2 id="updatesandupgrades">Updates and Upgrades</h2>
<p>Thanks to the good folks who <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/grammar-regulators-concede-to-the-modern-usage-of-a-word/256035/">control the <strong>AP Stylebook</strong></a>, it&rsquo;s now accepted to use the word &ldquo;hopefully&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;we hope.&rdquo; Prior to this week&rsquo;s update, the AP frowned on the modern usage, saying that &ldquo;hopefully&rdquo; could only be used to mean &ldquo;in a hopefully manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The textbook price-comparison app <a href="http://slugbooks.com"><strong>Slugbooks</strong></a> announced a partnership this week with 20 Million Minds, a California-based non-profit that&rsquo;s seeking to reduce the cost of college textbooks. Slugbooks will now power a <a href="http://www.20mm.org/Textbook-Search.html">widget on the 20MM website</a> where you compare prices and adoption.</p>
<p>And <strong>Akademos</strong>, another company in the textbook business, has also launched a <a href="http://adoption.akademos.com/">tool</a> to help professors make their textbook decisions based on price and faculty peer review.</p>
<p>The social study group company <a href="http://openstudy.com"><strong>Open Study</strong></a> has tweaked the way it hands out badges to those who participate on the site, unveiling what it calls a &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.openstudy.com/2012/04/17/redefining-%E2%80%9Csmart%E2%80%9D-openstudy-beyond-badges-and-points/">smart score</a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;a snapshot of your high-performing skills in core categories of teamwork, problem solving and engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="researchanddata">Research and Data</h2>
<p>A new California law requires all eighth graders take <strong>algebra</strong>, but according to research from UC Davis education professors, the requirement may <a href="http://www.futurity.org/society-culture/algebra-for-all-may-harm-many-kids/">do more harm than good</a>. &ldquo;We have an obligation as educators to ensure that the lowest-performing students do not see school as a punishment in the form of lower grades, social embarrassment and parental ire,&rdquo; says Dr. Heather Rose. Indeed.</p>
<p>Uh oh. It looks like there are some <a href="http://thehappyscientist.com/blog/problems-floridas-science-fcat-test">problems with <strong>Florida&rsquo;s standardized science test</strong></a>, including some major gaffs in, um, science. These include defining predator as &ldquo;an organism that obtains nutrients from other organisms.&rdquo; Ya know, like how cows obtain nutrients from plants. Good thing we&rsquo;re testing students to make sure they know this stuff!</p>
<p>Uh oh. &nbsp;It looks like New York state (okay, actually, <strong>Pearson</strong>) took an <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/04/20/daniel-pinkwater-on-pineapple-exam-nonsense-on-top-of-nonsense/">absurdist piece of writing from the wonderful Daniel Pinkwater</a> and used it in an eighth grade standardized test. &nbsp;There the story was both excerpted and altered (one of the protagonists changed from <a href="http://www.pinkwater.com/pzone/?p=80">an eggplant to a pineapple</a>), where it made even less sense than the original, particularly when all the multiple choice questions were equally right or wrong. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/nyregion/standardized-testing-is-blamed-for-question-about-a-sleeveless-pineapple.html">The New York Times has a longer look at the story</a>, which was being dubbed on Twitter "Pineapple-gate."</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mla.org"><strong>Modern Language Association</strong></a> has launched a <a href="http://www.mla.org/acad_work_search">tool</a> to compare colleges and the percentages of their faculty that are tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure track, as well as full and part-time. It&rsquo;s part of <a href="http://www.mla.org/fromthepres?topic=148">President Michael B&eacute;rub&eacute;&rsquo;s commitment</a> to address the state of the profession, which he describes with the words &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; and &ldquo;exploitation.&rdquo; (I heart Michael B&eacute;rub&eacute;.)</p>
<p>Justin Reich&rsquo;s done an excellent job looking at the <strong>automated essay grading software</strong> &ndash; the Kaggle competition, as well as the potential usage in the classroom: Part <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/edtechresearcher/2012/04/grading_automated_essay_scoring_programs-_part_i_bjfr.html">1</a>, <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/edtechresearcher/2012/04/grading_automated_essay_scoring_programs-_part_ii_policy_bjfr.html">2</a> and <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/edtechresearcher/2012/04/grading_automated_essay_scoring_programs-_part_iii_classrooms.html">3</a>. And just for laughs, here are a couple of places that&rsquo;ll automate paper writing for you: <a href="http://essaygenerator.com/">Essay Generator</a> and the <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/">CS paper generator</a> (this one is particularly awesome as it will submit your paper to an academic conference.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/countries/peru/an_alternative_reading_of_the_iadb_study_on_peru_olpc_implementation.html"><strong>One Laptop Per Child</strong> responds</a> to the recent headlines about <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/04/09/the-failure-of-olpc/">test scores in Peru</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Book Industry Study Group</strong> has found that, much like college students are sorta &ldquo;meh&rdquo; about e-textbooks, <a href="http://www.bisg.org/news-5-750-press-releasecollege-faculty-continue-their-love-affair-with-print-textbooks-says-new-bisg-study.php">faculty still prefer print</a>. 12% of faculty say they like digital content (compared to 16% of students who say they prefer digital to print).</p>
<h2 id="awards">Awards</h2>
<p>The <strong>Pulitzer Prizes</strong> were announced this week, and there were a number of winners whose work addressed education, including the <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2012-Local-Reporting">Harrisburg Patriot-News</a> (for its coverage of the Penn State sex scandal) and the <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2012-Public-Service">Philadelphia Inquirer</a> (for its look at violence in the city&rsquo;s schools).</p>
<h2 id="fundingandacquisition">Funding and Acquisition</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.digitalharborfoundation.org/">Digital Harbor Foundation</a>, an awesome new non-profit in Baltimore, has just announced it&rsquo;s received $200,000 from the Abell Foundation to support its <strong>EdTechLink</strong> program. It&rsquo;s a digital literacy and tech economy workforce development program that&rsquo;ll provide tech-related teacher training as well after-school programs for K&ndash;12 Baltimore public school students.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/education/student-loan-interest-rates-loom-as-political-battle.html">The New York Times suggests</a> we&rsquo;re poised to see <strong>student loans</strong> become a major political issue as the interest rates are set to double on July 1 (to 6.8%). President Obama wants to extend the low interest rate. Not really clear why the Republicans are opposed to this, but they&rsquo;re stonewalling the President here. Because that&rsquo;s politics, I guess. To hell with the rest of us.</p>
<p>Social tutorial site <a href="http://www.sophia.org/"><strong>Sophia</strong></a> has been acquired by <a href="http://www.capella.edu/">Capella University</a>. I covered <a href="/2011/03/07/social-teaching-and-learning-platform-sophia-launches-its-public-beta/">Sophia&rsquo;s launch on Hack Education</a> last year, noting the founder Don Smithier was a long-time Capella exec. So there ya go.</p>
<p>The learning management system startup <a href="http://schoology.com"><strong>Schoology</strong></a> announced that it has raised $6 million in funding, bringing its total investment to date to $9.3 million.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/18/web-dev-education-startup-treehouse-raises-4-75m-from-chamath-and-greylock/">Techcrunch reports</a> that the learn-to-develop-for-the-Web startup <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/"><strong>Treehouse</strong></a> has raised $4.75 in funding.</p>
<p>The latest in the recent spate of MOOC startups, <a href="http://coursera.org"><strong>Coursera</strong></a> announced it has raised $16 million in funding. My coverage is <a href="/admin/blog/">here</a>.</p>
