<p><strong>1.</strong> I am headed to <a href="educon23.org">EduCon</a> tomorrow.  I can't begin to tell you how excited I am to go.  I have been attending ed-tech conferences since 1997, but always as staff running either the registration or the event side of things.  I'm thrilled to actually <em>attend</em>.  There will be a lot of educators there that I admire, and I really can't do the work I do -- be an <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com">education technology</a> journalist -- without, ya know, talking to educators.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> I had a guest post on Edutopia's blog on the <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/blog/national-educational-technology-plan-netp-audrey-watters">National Educational Technology Plan</a> yesterday.  I think the piece turned out quite nicely.  I'm not holding my breath, unfortunately, for the implementation of the NETP to be so finely wrought.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/google">Google</a> made a big announcement this week by rolling out an educational category in the Apps Marketplace.  It's a big deal -- for schools and for ed-tech startups.  Here's my <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_apps_stocks_its_marketplace_full_of_educati.php">ReadWriteWeb coverage.</a> The whole marketplace concept has me thinking a lot about how we can better identify, promote, buy/sell from companies who get education.  More to come soon on that topic.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> If you are education technology startup, and you give an exclusive to Techcrunch, <em>you're doing it wrong.</em></p>
