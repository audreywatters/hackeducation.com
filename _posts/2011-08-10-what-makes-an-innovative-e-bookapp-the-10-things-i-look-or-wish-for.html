<p>News about e-readers and e-books and literary apps comes fairly steadily these days -- <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-new-stats-book-publishing-industry-is-growing-with-e-books-up-over-1000/">sales figures</a>, <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/08/10/amazon-shows-media-companies-the-future-of-the-web/">releases</a>, <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/08/10/with-4-new-products-kno-finally-looks-like-a-contender-in-the-e-textbook-industry/">updates</a>, <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/08/04/building-better-e-books/">acquisitions</a>. It's no surprise then, as a technology journalist, I watch the space closely. But I also do so as an avid reader and (former) literature scholar.</p>
<p>I wonder (and I worry) a lot about what digitization will entail for books, whose dictionary definition today -- for what it's worth -- does speak of the printed page bound together in a volume. Once we tear that apart and feed it through the OCR scanner, once we add animation and videos and audio, one must ask: what exactly <em>is</em> a book? I'll spare you the historical hand-wringing, in part because I'm pretty optimistic that books will continue to "be" <em>and</em> now have the potential to be something else, something "more."</p>
<p>As I think about what a book could be -- whether fiction or non-fiction, whether reading for business (or rather for school) or for pleasure -- I think about the following things when I weigh and when I dream about innovation:</p>
<h2>10 Things I Wish for in E-Books</h2>
<p><strong>1. A book should be easy to annotate.</strong> I should be able to write in the margins, and it should be easy to transfer, share, and store my highlights.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> I should be able to follow what other smart folks read, highlight, and annotate -- should they so choose, of course. Reading can be social. <strong>Reading <em>should be</em> social.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. If I'm going to pay <em>more</em> for an app (or for an e-book) than for a print book, I <em>want</em> more</strong>: you know, "bonus features" -- like on DVDs, only smarter. I don't want to pay $14.99 for a Kindle version of the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553801473/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hackeduc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=0553801473">Game of Thrones</a> novel, for crying out loud, simply because it's "new."</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> As my digital e-book collection grows, <strong>I'd like to be able to sort it by something other than title or author</strong>. I'd like to be able to group by topic (SF, for example) not just by "recent, title, author."</p>
<p><strong>5. I want to be able to own e-books</strong>. That means I want my books DRM-free. I'd like to be able to move my e-books from my Kindle app to my iBook app to my Xbox. And I want to be able to sell what I own -- used copies -- whatever that means in terms of giving up my ownership rights.</p>
<p><strong>6. I wouldn't object to reminders</strong> that it's been 90-some-odd days since I read a chapter in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812977866/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hackeduc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=0812977866">Super Sad True Love Story</a> by Gary Shteyngart or that it's been 160-days since I've purchased (and never opened!) Margaret Atwood's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307455475/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hackeduc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0307455475">The Year of the Flood</a> These reminders need to be fully customizable, because I have different feelings of guilt and panic about finishing or not finishing different books.</p>
<p><strong>7. I want interactive content.</strong> I want to link to the footnotes, to maps, to supplemental information. I also want the option to turn these links -- and all "interactive features" -- off.</p>
<p><strong>8. I want recommendations</strong> based on not just what I browse or buy via Amazon, but what I tweet, watch on Netflix, check in via <a href="http://getglue.com">GetGlue</a>.</p>
<p><strong>9. I want to be able to lend my books.</strong> Have you ever read Robert Anton Wilson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440539811/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hackeduc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0440539811">The Illuminatus</a>? Well you should. I'll lend you my copy. You'll love it. You'll buy your own. That's how it works. I want to be able to lend (e)books to my friends. I want to be able to lend (e)books to my son. "Here, read V for Vendetta. Then let's talk." I want to be able to lend books to my boyfriend. We watched Game of Thrones together on HBO. Now I've read the first four books in the series -- not the fifth, see above -- but I can't share.</p>
<p><strong>10. I want the e-book/app to work on any device, on and offline.</strong> I love the iPad, don't get me wrong. But to build e-book apps solely for that platform raises all sorts of questions about accessibility. E-books should be a boon, not a barrier, to literacy.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear what others have on their wishlist for e-books.</p>
