<p>I have an article in this month's School Library Journal titled "<a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2012/04/digital-divide/what-tech-in-schools-really-looks-like/">What Tech in Schools Really Looks Like</a>."  I open with the famous quotation from cyberpunk author William Gibson:  "The future is here; it's just not evenly distributed."  Indeed, the distribution of technology is radically uneven, I argue.  The stats look good -- almost all public schools say they have computers, almost all say they have Internet access.  But that doesn't mean the computers are new or the network access is fast.  And it certainly doesn't mean that technology has transformed teaching and learning.</p>
