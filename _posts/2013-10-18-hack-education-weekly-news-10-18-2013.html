<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p>The <strong>US government</strong> is back open again. Whee. The cost of the shutdown: an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sp-cuts-us-growth-view-2013-10">estimated $24 billion dollars</a>. You know what else we could have done with that $24 billion? <a href="http://strikedebt.org/how-far-to-free/">Free public higher education</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>US Supreme Court</strong> is again considering an <strong>affirmative action</strong> case. This time, a <strong>Michigan</strong> constitutional amendment that prevents the state from considering race in public education, employment, and contracting. Folks are predicting that the court will uphold the state law.

<h2>Upgrades and Downgrades</h2>
<p>Because <a href="http://www.codeyear.com/">Code Year</a> wasn&rsquo;t enough to teach everybody to code, <strong>Code.org</strong> &ndash; a new non-profit that aims to expand programming education &ndash; is launching &ldquo;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-10-15-the-hour-of-code-is-coming">the Hour of Code</a>.&rdquo;</p>

How to apply Skinnerism to mobile apps? How to track a bunch of data points in order to sell ads or in-game purchases? How to lose a bunch of money after you IPO? So many exciting possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Wolfram Alpha</strong> has launched a new tool called the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/pro/problem-generator.html">Wolfram Problem Generator</a> (available to pro subscribers) that, as the name suggests, creates unlimited, random practice problems.</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="http://qcraft.org/">qCraft</a>, &ldquo;a mod that brings the principles of quantum physics to the world of <strong>Minecraft</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>George Mason University</strong>&rsquo;s Institute for Humane Studies has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-10-17-institute-for-humane-studies-announces-free-online-curriculum-hub">launched</a> <strong>EDvantage</strong>, a free online curriculum hub for educators. It&rsquo;s 2013, and one of the biggest ed-tech trends this year seems to be content hubs and portals. Good grief. The innovation. It burns.</p>
<p><strong>McGraw-Hill</strong> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20131016-907528.html">launched</a> what it&rsquo;s calling the &ldquo;first adaptive, open-response placement and remediation tool for higher education&rdquo;: ALEKS Placement, Preparation and Learning. (McGraw-Hill acquired <strong>ALEKS</strong> earlier this year. The private equity firm Apollo Group acquired McGraw-Hill in 2012. The beat goes on.)</p>
<p>The <strong>20 Million Minds Foundation</strong> has <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/textbooks-in-your-pocket-free-interactive-books-for-core-classes-227771121.html">partnered</a> with <strong>Inkling</strong> to publish two <strong>OpenStax</strong> openly-licensed textbooks &ndash; Introduction to Sociology and College Physics &ndash; on Inkling&rsquo;s e-book platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://khanacademy.tumblr.com/post/63781720693/calculus-on-khan-academy-coming-fall-2014">Coming soon</a> to <strong>Khan Academy</strong>: a complete Calculus course. Khan Academy is partnering with the prestigious boarding school <strong>Phillips Academy</strong> to create the course. Tuition at Phillips Academy will run you $47K a year, but hey, now you can learn from the most elite institutions for free!! Hmmm. Where have I heard that argument before?!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/education/online-application-woes-make-students-anxious-and-put-colleges-behind-schedule.html">The New York Times highlights</a> the problems that the latest version online <strong>Common Application</strong> has had this fall. Designed to streamline college applications to some 500 schools, the site &ldquo;has been plagued by numerous malfunctions, alarming students and parents and putting admissions offices weeks behind schedule.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>(A Quiet Week for) MOOC News</h2>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/64164078376/coursera-partners-with-the-world-bank">partners</a> with the <strong>World Bank.</strong></p>
<p>The German online education startup <strong>iversity</strong> has launched its first MOOC classes this week. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/14/iversity-initial-students/">Techcrunch has the details</a>.</p>
<h2>Funding and Acquisitions</h2>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/16/facebook-learning-platform-izzui-hedges-bets-that-ed-tech-will-take-off-in-brazil/">Venture Beat reports</a> that the Brazilian startup <strong>Izzui</strong> has raised $1.4 million &ldquo;to build its platform, where individuals and brands can create, publish, share, and sell courses on <strong>Facebook</strong>.&rdquo;</p>

Learning management systems are, indeed, the undead of education technology, aren&rsquo;t they.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p>The results of this year&rsquo;s <strong>Campus Computing Survey</strong> are out. Among its findings, the LMS market share by <strong>Blackboard</strong> has fallen to 41%, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/10/17/survey-shows-it-service-dominates-top-priorities-among-university-it-officials">a decline of 30 percentage points in six years</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Gallup</strong> released the results of its recent survey on the public&rsquo;s perception of online education. <a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/traditional-education-beats-online-in-key-areas-many-say-in-gallup-survey/47363">The headline for The Chronicle</a> story on the survey: &ldquo;Traditional Education Beats Online in Key Areas, Opinion Poll Finds.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/10/15/american-adults-see-online-courses-least-equivalent-most-ways">Inside Higher Ed</a> interprets the survey to indicate the public thinks online education is &ldquo;at least as good&rdquo; as offline. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/10/15/american-adults-see-online-courses-least-equivalent-most-ways">Here&rsquo;s a link to the actual survey</a>. Interpret for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Educause</strong> has released its <a href="https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERS1302/ERS1302.pdf">annual survey</a> which asks some 113,000 undergraduate students about their technology usage. Among the findings: students aren&rsquo;t interested in badges; students&rsquo; computing device ownership continues to grow; and 71% of students have used free or openly licensed educational resources.</p>
<p>Back online after the government shutdown, the <strong>NCES</strong> has published &ldquo;Selected Statistics from the Common Core of Data: School Year 2011&ndash;12.&rdquo; <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2013441">View the PDF</a>. (Where&rsquo;s the machine-readable format, guys?)</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/study-poor-children-are-now-the-majority-in-american-public-schools-in-south-west/2013/10/16/34eb4984-35bb-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story.html">research</a> from the Southern Education Foundation, &ldquo;a majority of students in public schools throughout the American South and West are <strong>low-income</strong> for the first time in at least four decades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The National Bureau of Economic Research has released its <a href="http://cepa.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/w19529.pdf">analysis</a> of <strong>IMPACT</strong>, DC&rsquo;s teacher evaluation system. <a href="http://shankerblog.org/?p=8927">Matthew Di Carlo from the Shanker Institute</a> has a helpful reading of the findings.</p>
<p>The <strong>Joan Ganz Cooney Center</strong> has released a &ldquo;Comparative Analysis of National Teacher Surveys&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jgcc_teacher_survey_analysis_final.pdf">PDF</a>), that looks at the results from across 5 recent surveys about teaching, tech, and media. One observation made in this analysis: &ldquo;when asked how technology is beneficial to the students&rsquo; learning, there was an emphasis on learning processes and higher-level skills rather than on academic achievement.&rdquo; In other words, teachers are skeptical that tech will boost test scores, the report argues.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2013/oct13/10-15skillspr.aspx">released</a> a study that says one of the most important skills students will need for good jobs: Microsoft Office (#2 behind &ldquo;oral and written communication skills.&rdquo;) Rounding out this totally unbiased and forward-thinking list: #19 ethics and #20 Linux. LOL.</p>
<p>According to the latest <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Tablets-and-ereaders.aspx">report</a> from the <strong>Pew Internet and American Life Project</strong>, 43% of American adults own tablets or e-readers. (22% of those who earn less than $30K a year do; 65% of those who earn more than $150K a year do; 27% of those who live in rural areas do; 37% of those in the suburbs do.)</p>
<h2>Surveilling Students</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Facebook</strong> Eases Privacy Rules for Teenagers,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/technology/facebook-changes-privacy-policy-for-teenagers.html">reads The New York Times headline</a> about the news this week that Facebook will allow teens to post their information on the social network publicly. (Up until now, teens&rsquo; posts and photos were restricted to friends.) Alternate headline: &ldquo;Facebook Expands Its Advertising Base.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Common Sense Media</strong> penned a letter to 16 education technology companies, asking them &ldquo;to use student data only for educational purposes, and not for marketing products to children or their families.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/technology/concerns-arise-over-privacy-of-schoolchildrens-data.html">More details in The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>universities of Sunderland and Ulster</strong> in the UK have installed <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/biometric-scanners-used-to-keep-tabs-on-overseas-students/2008205.article#.Ul-KLRnP1CI.twitter">biometric monitoring systems</a> on their satellite campuses, <strong>fingerprinting</strong> the international students (not British ones) to make sure they&rsquo;re attending lectures.</p>
<p>Lots of talk about <strong>big data</strong> and <strong>learning analytics</strong> at <strong>Educause</strong> this week. <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/10/18/u-kentucky-hopes-boost-student-retention-prescriptive-analytics">Inside Higher Ed</a> takes a look at the <strong>University of Kentucky</strong>&rsquo;s hopes to boost student retention with &ldquo;prescriptive analytics.&rdquo; <strong>Rey Junco</strong> examines the potential for <a href="http://blog.reyjunco.com/texbook-analytics-a-new-way-to-do-learning-analytics">textbook analytics</a>. Are there companies offering biometric monitoring systems in the exhibits, anyone?</p>
<p>The textbook startup <strong>Zookal</strong> has <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/10/15/drones-deliver-textbooks/">partnered</a> with the <strong>drone</strong> service Flirtey to deliver students in Australia their textbooks within minutes of ordering them. I hope they stick around and monitor the students while they read their textbooks too &ndash; think of the potential for learning analytics, Rey!</p>
