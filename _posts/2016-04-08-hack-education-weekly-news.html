<br />
<p>I won&#8217;t include this in <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">my calculations of ed-tech investment</a>, but as many folks are using this software for educational purposes, I&#8217;ll make note of this here: &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/technology/slack-a-leading-unicorn-raises-200-million-in-new-financing.html">Slack, a Leading Unicorn, Raises $200 Million in New Financing</a>.&#8221; Investors in this round include Thrive Capital, GGV, Comcast Ventures, Accel Partners, and Spark Growth. The communication/collaboration platform has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/slack#/entity">$539.95 million</a> total.</p>

<p>Claned has raised $4.5 million in Series A funding. Here&#8217;s how the company is <a href="http://arcticstartup.com/article/finnish-edtech-claned-raises-4-million-euros-before-launch">described by Arctic Startup</a>: &#8220;The Helsinki-based startup is solving the riddle one-size-fits-all approach in learning as it is developing a personal learning platform. Empowered by artificial intelligence, the platform will show each user&#8217;s study performance and learning orientation, and help individual to discover a personal way of learning for maximizing results.&#8221; It&#8217;s raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tribalearning-2#/entity">$9.02 million</a> total and hasn&#8217;t even launched yet. The list of investors for this and previous funding rounds are not disclosed. Sounds totally legit.</p>

<p>Schoold has raised a <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-04-04-college-and-career-planning-app-schoold-raises-4-5-million">$4.5 million</a> seed round from FastForward and Lorne Abony. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorne_Abony">According to Wikiepdia</a>, Abony is the founder of Schoold (a college search app) as well as Vemo Education, a private student loan company. He was also once on the reality TV show <em>Undercover Boss</em>, for those keeping score at home. I dunno folks, $4.5 million is a big seed round for a pretty basic search app, so maybe this is some <em>Undercover Investor</em> gag for ed-tech.</p>

<p>Always Be Learning Inc. (a.k.a. Abl Schools) has raised <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/01/yammer-co-founder-adam-pisoni-raises-4-5-million-for-abl-schools/">$4.5 million</a> from Owl Ventures, Reach Capital, and First Round Capital.

<p>Sawyer has raised <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/aiming-to-be-the-opentable-of-kids-activities-sawyer-raises-1-5-million/">$1.5 million</a> in seed funding from Notation Capital, Collaborative Fund, and VC1 in order to be &#8220;the OpenTable of kids&#8217; activities.&#8221;</p>
