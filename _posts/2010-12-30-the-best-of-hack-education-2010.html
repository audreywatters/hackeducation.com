<p>Well, I really only get credit for the "best of the second half of 2010" since I started this blog in June.  And let my say right here: "best domain name ever."  Since I started collecting my ed-tech thoughts here (as opposed to on <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com">my personal blog</a>), I've been incredibly pleased and grateful with how quickly Hack Education has been taken off.  Thanks, all, for reading.</p>
<p>So in the spirit of "wow, look what I did" during the last six months of ed-tech blogging, here is a list of my most successful and my most favorite posts.</p>
