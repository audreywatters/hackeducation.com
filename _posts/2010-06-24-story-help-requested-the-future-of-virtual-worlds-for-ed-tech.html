<p>With some of the recent <a href="http://blogs.secondlife.com/community/features/blog/2010/06/24/returning-to-the-lab">reshuffling</a> at Linden Labs, I've been thinking a lot lately about the implications for educators who've heavily invested (time, expertise, budget, curriculum development) in virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Are virtual worlds viable (in the classroom and/or as a business)?  Do they require too much tech investment/knowledge from educators?  Are there too many security/privacy/safety issues -- real or imagined --about having kids in virtual worlds?  While I've seen some really amazing and innovative classroom and PD projects based in Second Life, has tech development actually moved in a direction different from the path taking by the virtual world early adopters?</p>
<p>I'm working on a story on this subject, and I'm looking for insights from educators.  You can reach me at <a href="mailto:audrey@readwriteweb.com">audrey@readwriteweb.com</a>.</p>
