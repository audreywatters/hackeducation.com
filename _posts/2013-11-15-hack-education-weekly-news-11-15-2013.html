<h2>Education Hardware Upgrades</h2>
<p><strong>MakerBot</strong> announced its <strong><a href="http://www.makerbot.com/academy/">MakerBot Academy</a></strong>. Its mission: &ldquo;to put a MakerBot Desktop 3D Printer in every school in America.&rdquo; MakerBot is <a href="http://help.donorschoose.org/app/answers/detail/a_id/451">working with DonorsChoose.org</a> to help teachers fundraise for their MakerBot bundle.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> launched its <a href="http://google.com/edu/tablets">Google Play for Education</a> program this week: Android tablets and an app store for schools. My review is <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/11/13/google-play-for-education/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Education Hardware Recalls and Delays</h2>
<p>The <strong>Chromebook</strong> 11 (made by HP) has been <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2013/hp-chromebook-11-disappears-retailers-explanation/">pulled</a> from stores due to a problem with chargers overheating. (I have to imagine that <a href="http://slashdot.org/story/13/10/08/1952215/nc-school-district-recalls-its-amplify-tablets-after-10-break-in-under-a-month">Amplify is breathing a sigh of relief here</a>.)</p>
<p>The <strong>Los Angeles Board of Education</strong> agreed to continue, but scale back, its troubled&nbsp;<strong>iPad</strong> rollout this week. Included in the changes to the plan, an assessment of how tablets affect student achievement. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-1113-lausd-20131113,0,1290815.story#axzz2kXXjjdMn">More details via The LA Times</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Miami-Dade School District</strong> is <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/11/13/3751500/dade-delays-tech-rollout-as-other.html">delaying</a> its massive, $63 million 1:1 technology rollout. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said that events elsewhere (in Los Angeles, no doubt) prompted the district to move more slowly.</p>
<h2>MOOOOCs, Disrupted</h2>
<p><strong>Udacity</strong> <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2013/11/sebastian-thrun-launching-our-data.html">announced</a> this week that it&rsquo;s launching a &ldquo;Data Science and Big Data Track,&rdquo; partnering with Hadoop provider <strong>Cloudera</strong> for the curriculum.</p>
<p>That news was well-timed with <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3021473/udacity-sebastian-thrun-uphill-climb">a Fast Company profile</a> of <strong>Udacity</strong> co-founder <strong>Sebastian Thrun</strong> that suggests the company is pivoting, away from higher ed disruption and to more of this corporate-sponsored tech training. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/11/14/thrun-as-saint/">My thoughts</a>. <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2013/11/15/the-failure-of-udacity/">George Siemens&rsquo; thoughts</a>. <a href="http://allmoocs.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/udacity-shifting-models-means-never-having-to-say-youre-sorry/">Rolin Moe&rsquo;s thoughts</a>. <a href="http://hapgood.us/2013/11/14/thrun-enters-burgeoning-sieve-market/">Mike Caulfield's thoughts</a>. <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/11/stop-me-if-you-think-youve-heard-this-one-before.html">Martin Weller&rsquo;s thoughts</a>. <a href="http://theory.cribchronicles.com/2013/11/15/in-the-wake-of-mooc-hype/">Bonnie Stewart&rsquo;s thoughts</a>. (You get the picture.)</p>
<p>But hey.&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2013/11/14/introducing-a-new-way-to-add-certifications-to-your-linkedin-profile/">You can now show off your MOOC certificates on <strong>LinkedIn</strong></a>. So&nbsp;<em>that</em> changes everything.</p>
<h2>Other Online Edu Efforts</h2>
<p><strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong> has <a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/new-council-to-develop-standards-best-practices-for-online-learning/48171">created</a> a <strong>Global Learning Council</strong> to &ldquo;spearhead efforts to develop standards and promote best practices in online education.&rdquo; Council members include edX's Anant Agarwal and Coursera's Daphne Koller. &ldquo;Global,&rdquo; but with US representatives only, seeking to identify &ldquo;best practices,&rdquo; because nobody out there already does that. Sigh.</p>
<p>In a story about the &ldquo;sharing economy&rdquo; in <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/11/12/airbnb-starts-teaching-hospitality/">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <strong>AirBnB</strong> founder Brian Chesky hinted that the startup is &ldquo;considering investing in additional e-learning software for hosts.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a Udacity joke to be made here, isn't there.</p>
<h2>Elsewhere, For Credit</h2>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong> has launched&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/13/facebook-open-academy/">Open Academy</a>,&nbsp;a partnership with 22 universities that will set up a special class where students can get college credit for contributing to open source projects.</p>
<h2>Investment, IPOs, and Acquisitions</h2>
<p>Textbook rental company <strong>Chegg</strong> had its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/13/in-187-5m-ipo-chegg-debuts-on-nyse-in-twitters-shadow-as-shares-slump-15-percent/">IPO</a> this week, raising $187.5 million.

Shares were initially priced at $12 and haven&rsquo;t dropped below that, hitting a high this week of $16.20.</p>
<p><strong>Kidaptive</strong> has raised $10.1 million in Series B funding, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/14/educational-ipad-app-maker-kidaptive-scores-10-1-million-series-b/">reports Techcrunch&rsquo;s Sarah Perez</a> who offers a closer look at the startup&rsquo;s iPad apps.</p>
<p>Online education startup <strong>CreativeLive</strong> has raised $21.5 million, bringing its total funding to $29.5 million, <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2013/creativelive-lands-215m-upend-online-education-live-broadcasts-courses/">reports GeekWire</a>.</p>

<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p><strong>Yvette Sanchez Fuentes</strong>, the head of <strong>Head Start</strong>, has <a href="http://www.stnonline.com/home/latest-news/5746-sanchez-fuentes-to-leave-office-of-head-start">announced</a> her resignation, effective November 22.</p>
<p><strong>Sylvia Manning</strong>, the president of the <strong>Higher Learning Commission </strong>of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, has announced she&rsquo;s stepping down. The Chronicle of Higher Education has a look at her &ldquo;<a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/142985/">bumpy tenure</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Reed</strong>, Vice President Joe Biden&rsquo;s Chief of Staff, has been named president of the <strong><a href="http://www.broadfoundation.org/">Broad Foundation</a></strong>, one of the big 3 philanthropies helping shape education policy.</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> has abandoned &ldquo;stack ranking,&rdquo; its system of grading employees against one another, then firing or pushing out the poor performers. Stank ranking was the <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2012/07/microsoft-downfall-emails-steve-ballmer">subject of a story in Vanity Fair last year</a> which blamed the system for crippling the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;ability to innovate.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/05/1106417/-Gates-s-Cannibalistic-Culture-Coming-to-a-School-Near-You">Some have suggested</a> that this practice has been the model for the Gates Foundation&rsquo;s efforts to push for a similar rating system for teachers &ndash; &ldquo;rank and yank.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Education Politics</h2>
<p>Senators Dick Durbin and Al Franken have&nbsp;<a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/2-senators-will-offer-bill-promoting-open-access-textbooks/48359">proposed</a>&nbsp;the <strong>Affordable College Textbook Act</strong> that &ldquo;would encourage the creation of free online textbooks by offering grants for pilot projects that produce high-quality open-access textbooks, especially for courses with large enrollments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pre-K legislation was also introduced in the US Senate and House this week.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/blog/strong-start-americas-children-act-bill-summary">The Strong Start for America&rsquo;s Children Act</a></strong>&nbsp;would fund pre-kindergarten education for all low- and moderate-income children in the US. Not too many folks are optimistic about the bill&rsquo;s chances, because you know, Congress is broken.</p>
<p><strong>First Lady Michelle Obama</strong> kicked off her new initiative this week:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/13/michelle-obama-speech-signals-new-administration-focus-boosting-low-income-college">college for everyone</a>.</p>
<p>The comments have closed regarding <strong>E-Rate</strong> reform. (ISTE, which led an effort to gather comments supporting E-Rate expansion, says that its members contributed some 40% of the 1000 comments submitted.) Ben Kamisar,&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2013/11/as_the_final_public_comment.html">in an op-ed for Education Week</a>, suggests the FCC could expand E-Rate beyond schools and libraries &ndash; something that makes me wonder what would happen to Internet filtering per CIPA. Hrmm.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/stateimpact/2013/11/14/indiana-inspector-general-files-ethics-complaint-tony-bennett/">The Indiana Inspector General has filed an ethics complaint</a>&nbsp;against former state superintendent and education reform darling <strong>Tony Bennett</strong> &ldquo;for using state computers for campaign business during his 2012 reelection bid.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-exclusive-gop-donors-school-grade-changed">Earlier this year</a>, the AP reported that Bennett had changed the grade for a school of one of his donors.</p>
<h2>Education in the Courts</h2>
<p><strong>Google</strong> has finally won its eight-year-long legal battle with the <strong>Authors Guild </strong>over the search giant&rsquo;s efforts to digitize millions of books. US Circuit Judge Denny Chin said that the scanning was &ldquo;tranformative&rdquo; and as such amounted to fair use. More&nbsp;<a href="https://chronicle.com/article/Judge-Hands-Google-a-Big/143059/">via Jen Howard in The Chronicle</a>&nbsp;(paywalled. bummer) and&nbsp;<a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/11/14/google-wins-book-scanning-case-judge-finds-fair-use-cites-many-benefits/">via Jeff John Roberts in GigaOm</a>. The full decision is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ndmugw443nz36w/google%20summary%20judgment%20final.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Citing privacy concerns, parents in New York&nbsp;<a href="http://www.classsizematters.org/ny-lawsuit-filed-to-protect-student-privacy-and-block-inbloom/">filed a lawsuit</a>&nbsp;against Commissioner of Education John King and the Board of Regents, asking to block the state&rsquo;s partnership with <strong>inBloom</strong> and implementation of the non-profit&rsquo;s data infrastructure.</p>
<p>After being sent back to a lower court by the Supreme Court earlier this year, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals began re-hearing arguments in the <strong>affirmative action</strong> case&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/">Fisher v Texas</a></strong>.</p>
<p>An appeals court in <strong>Florida</strong> has&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/gradebook/appeal-court-orders-release-of-controversial-vam-data/2152057">ordered</a>&nbsp;the release of teachers&rsquo; performance data, after the Florida Times-Union filed a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Sampo IP is suing <strong>Blackboard</strong> for <strong>patent infringement</strong>. But before you shout,&nbsp;<a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/blackboard-settles-longstanding-patent-fight-with-rival-desire2learn/9229">&ldquo;KARMA!&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;it&rsquo;s important to remember,&nbsp;<a href="http://mfeldstein.com/patent-troll-sues-blackboard-patent-infringement/">as Michael Feldstein writes</a>, that patent trolls are bad news, no matter who they go after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CoolCatTeacher&rdquo; Vicki Davis has&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coolcatteacher.com/flat-classroom/">announced</a>&nbsp;via her blog that the&nbsp;<strong>Flat Classroom Project</strong>&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t earning enough money to support both her and her co-founder Julie Lindsay. But the process of figuring out &ldquo;what next&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t sound like it&rsquo;s going too smoothly, and the two are headed to court to dissolve the company and split the assets via legal proceedings.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; and Data</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Pearson</strong> commits to measure and report impact on learning outcomes,&rdquo; announces the <a href="http://www.4-traders.com/PEARSON-PLC-4000637/news/Pearson-plc--Pearson-commits-to-measure-and-report-impact-on-learning-outcomes-17465702/">press release</a>. The education giant&rsquo;s report &ldquo;Asking More: The Path to Efficacy brings together some of the world&rsquo;s leading education experts to highlight how research and data collection can enable a revolutionary degree of rigour in measuring and improving the success of learning products, educational programmes and institutions.&rdquo; Nothing gets me more excited on a Friday afternoon, I tell you what, than a revolutionary degree of rigour.</p>
<p>Inside Higher Ed reports on <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/14/new-gre-data-illustrate-trends-future-graduate-students">demographics data from <strong>GRE</strong>-test takers</a>: &ldquo;Test-takers who took the GRE in 2012&ndash;13 were more likely to be a bit younger and a bit more science-oriented than those who took the exam the year before. And in the quantitative portion of the exam, in particular, foreign talent appears to be outpacing American.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Phil Hill</strong> has <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/state-anglospheres-higher-education-lms-market-2013-edition/">published</a> the 2013 version of the <strong>State of the Anglosphere&rsquo;s Higher Education LMS Market</strong>. &ldquo;There are no dramatic changes to the market in general this year,&rdquo; Hill writes. &ldquo;The same players keep growing (primarily <strong>Canvas</strong>, followed by <strong>Moodle</strong> and <strong>Desire2Learn</strong>), and the same players keep shrinking (primarily <strong>Blackboard</strong>). The only new potential system of interest this year is OpenEdX.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Open data</strong> in New York City has resulted in a batch of new apps to help students and their families select a high school, thanks to an initiative supported by the NYC DOE&rsquo;s iZone team. <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2013/11/nyc_turns_to_open_data_to_help.html">More details at Education Week</a>.</p>

<h2>Sports and Schooling</h2>
<p>Judge Claudia Wilken has certified that the student-athletes suing the <strong>NCAA</strong> have class action status for some of their claims, but she denied them the ability to sue as a class for damages relating to the use of their images and likenesses. <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/article-content/142927/">More details on the lawsuit via The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Denver Broncos</strong> player John Moffit says he&rsquo;s walking away from professional football <a href="http://critical-theory.com/nfl-player-quits-because-know-noam-chomsky/">after reading <strong>Noam Chomsky</strong></a>. Curse you, &ldquo;liberal arts education&rdquo; &ndash; you are always spoiling everyone&rsquo;s fun and profits.</p>
