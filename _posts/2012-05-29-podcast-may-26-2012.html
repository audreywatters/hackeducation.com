<p>I typically write that "every week, <a href="http://stevehargadon.com">Steve Hargadon</a> and I sit down for our weekly podcast." &nbsp;But in this case, it's been two weeks. &nbsp;As such, we blasted through a bunch of content, covering <a href="/2012/05/24/maker-faire-2012/">Maker Faire</a> and the <a href="/2012/05/24/open-education-summit-storified/">Open Education Summit</a> -- two events we both attended -- as well as a couple of weeks' worth of education technology news and reviews. &nbsp;That includes thoughts on the definition of&nbsp;<a href="/2012/05/19/ed-tech-definition/">ed-tech</a>&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>The link to the MP3 of the show is below, and/or you can subscribe to  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/edtechlive/hackeducation">the podcast feed</a>. You can also find the podcast in iTunes, as part of Steve's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/edtechlive/id219875737">EdTechLive series</a>.</p>
