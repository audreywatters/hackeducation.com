<h3>Education Law and Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>The FCC voted 3&#8211;2 that broadband Internet will be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/technology/net-neutrality-fcc-vote-internet-utility.html">regulated as a public utility</a>. A win for Net Neutrality and the open Internet (but let's remember, none of this is really "neutral").</p>

<p>The US House of Representatives is <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0215/morningeducation17259.html">working its way</a> through the 40-some-odd amendments tacked on to the No Child Left Behind re-write. (It was initially scheduled to vote on the bill today. The White House has <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2015/02/white_house_issues_veto_threat_1.html">threatened a veto</a>.) The House also <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2015/02/25/house-votes-to-expand-college-accounts-obama-wanted-to-scrap">voted</a> to expand the college savings plan that President Obama had (at least in his State of the Union address) indicated he wanted to scrap.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="http://metronews.ca/news/calgary/1295499/fears-arise-that-albertas-athabasca-university-will-be-lost-as-tough-budget-looms/">Fears arise that Alberta's Athabasca University will be lost as tough budget looms</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/arne-duncan-spends-visit-to-local-elementary-schoo,38107/">From The Onion</a>, &#8220;Arne Duncan Spends Visit To Local Elementary School Looking At UFO Books In Library.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel did not win enough votes to secure a second term in office. <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2015/0225/Chicago-surprise-Why-Rahm-Emanuel-faces-a-runoff-and-can-he-survive-it-video">He&#8217;ll face Jesus &#8220;Chuy&#8221; Garcia</a> &#8211; a candidate backed by the teachers&#8217; union &#8211; in a run-off.</p>

<p>The US Department of Education <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/guidance-issued-protecting-student-privacy-while-using-online-educational-services">released</a> model Terms of Service guidance &#8220;aimed at helping schools and districts protect student privacy while using online educational services and applications.&#8221; (It&#8217;s, um, interesting that the &#8220;best practice&#8221; guidelines suggest that TOS should say schools &#8211; not students &#8211; own the data, including all IP.)</p>

<p>Much like its neighbor state Wyoming, Colorado is now looking at allowing <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/27/389245938/colorado-pushes-for-concealed-guns-in-k-12-schools">concealed weapons</a> at K&#8211;12 schools, repealing a law that makes schools &#8220;gun-free zones&#8221;.</p>

<p>A lawsuit was <a href="http://laschoolreport.com/just-in-new-lawsuit-charges-cortines-with-sexual-misconduct/">filed</a> this week charging LAUSD superintendent Ramon Cortines of sexual harassment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2015/0225/ISIS-burns-Mosul-library-Why-terrorists-target-books">ISIS has burned the Mosul Library</a>, which housed over 8000 rare ancient books and manuscripts. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/ISIS-Video-Militants-Smashing-Ancient-Artifacts-Mosul-Museum/386198/">ISIS also released video footage</a> of them destroying Assyrian and Akkadian artifacts in Mosul, some that date back to the 7th century BC.</p>

<h3>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/190247/">From The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, &#8220;How [Jerry Falwell&#8217;s] Liberty Ubecame an unexpected model for the future of higher education.&#8221; Um. &#8220;A standard syllabus, even in a course with no obvious religious connection, encourages students to pray in online forums.&#8221; Prayer and grit. That&#8217;s all you need, kids.</p>

<p>Well here&#8217;s another business opportunity for MOOC providers: the Corrective Education Company offers online courses for those busted for shoplifting. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2015/02/shoplifting_at_whole_foods_or_bloomingdale_s_pay_corrective_education_company.html">Via Slate</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you're browsing at Bloomingdale's when a security guard taps you on the shoulder and accuses you of shoplifting. He takes you to a private room, sits you down, and runs your name through a database to see if you have any outstanding warrants. Then he tells you that you have two options. The first involves him calling the police, who might arrest you and take you to jail. The second allows you to walk out of the store immediately, no questions asked - right after you sign an admission of guilt and agree to pay $320 to take an online course designed to make you never want to steal again. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If learning how to not shoplift isn&#8217;t your thing, perhaps this: &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2015/02/24/want-to-hone-your-school-reformer-skills-jeb-bushs-foundation-has-a-mooc-for-you/">Want to hone your school reformer skills? Jeb Bush’s foundation has a MOOC for you</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michigan State University is <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/02/24/michigan-state-tests-telepresence-robots-for-online-students.aspx">experimenting</a> with using telepresence robots for distance ed students so that they can participate in face-to-face classes.</p>

<p>&#8220;A global network of fraudulent online universities is using high-pressure sales tactics and phony scholarships to extract money from students who end up with worthless degrees,&#8221; <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/190337/">reports The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>. MUST University, which boasts that it&#8217;s the &#8220;world&#8217;s largest university,&#8221; lists its address in San Francisco. Because of course, where else would you run a scam like that, eh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ivy League Grads Are Turning Their Backs On The Peace Corps.&#8221; (The number of Ivy grad volunteers has fallen by 63% in the last decade, <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/culture/society/peace-corps-ivy-league/">reports Vocativ</a>. This story is sorta odd as the number of volunteers from other schools has stayed about the same and far surpasses those from Ivy League schools. But ya know, the arc of education reporting is long and it bends towards the Ivies.)</p>

She&#8217;s filed a lawsuit charging the university of violating Title IX, in part by not investigating the rape charges. WTF, Ducks. Thankfully, by the end of the week, the university had backed away from the countersuit. </p>
