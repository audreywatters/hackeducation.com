<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 1 of my <a href="http://2012trends.hackeducation.com">Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2012</a> series</em></p>

<p>Last year when I wrote about the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/ed-tech-trends-2011">top 10 trends in ed-tech</a>, I saved &ldquo;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/16/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2011-the-business-of-ed-tech">The Business of Ed-Tech</a>&rdquo; for the penultimate post. I&rsquo;m starting my series there this time around. There&rsquo;ll be plenty of opportunity throughout these year-end posts of mine to discuss the ways in which technology has shaped teaching and learning in 2012. But I want to recognize from the outset much of what we&rsquo;ve seen this year is how technology will shape the business of education.</p>

<h3>The (Story of the) Business of Ed-Tech</h3>
<br />
<p>It's been a major story this year: broken educational institutions <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober_2012/features/_its_three_oclock_in039373.php">under seige by Silicon Valley</a>.</p>

<p>Last year I noted the uptick in journalistic coverage of ed-tech (most notably with the launch of <a href="http://edsurge.com">Edsurge</a>), and the topic appeared in the media with increasing regularity in 2012. Much of this focused on the most notable ed-tech trends: iPads, Khan Academy, social media &nbsp;(the good and the bad), online learning, and MOOCs. The &ldquo;age old&rdquo; dilemma of whether kids still need to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/12/omg-cursive-education-on-the-chopping-block/">learn cursive</a>. The usual.</p>

<p>Increasing interest in ed-tech was particularly evident in the trade press. The long-running publication <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/index.html">Education Week</a> launched a new blog, <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/">Marketplace K&ndash;12</a>, for example, to focus on &ldquo;business trends and emerging models in education.&rdquo; Investor Tom Vander Ark also began blogging there with a regular column on &ldquo;<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/on_innovation/">Innovation</a>.&rdquo; For its part, the ed-tech blog upstart Edsurge raised <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/29/edsurge-funding/">$400,000 in funding</a> from the Washington Post Company and New Schools Venture Fund.</p>
