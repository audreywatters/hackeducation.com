<p>Once again, I am using <a href="http://storify.com">Storify</a> to publish all my various notes and Tweets and photos from a conference.  This week was <a href="http://sxswedu.com">SXSWedu</a>, which was pretty "meh" as far as conferences go but pretty awesome as far as meeting folks like David Wiley, Jim Groom, and Alan Levine.</p>
