<p>Much like my annual look at the &#8220;<a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">Top Ed-Tech Trends</a>,&#8221; in previous years I&#8217;ve selected what I thought were the &#8220;Top Ed-Tech Startups.&#8221; (See <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2011/12/18/top-10-ed-tech-startups-of-2011">2011</a>, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/21/top-10-ed-tech-startups-of-2012">2012</a>, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/12/29/top-10-ed-tech-startups-of-2013">2013</a>.) It&#8217;s something I started doing in 2010 when, as a tech blogger at ReadWriteWeb, I was assigned to write the year-end <a href="http://readwrite.com/2010/12/27/top_10_startups_of_2010">Top Startups article</a>. </p>

<p>At the time, I made up some rules to limit my selection (mostly so my list didn&#8217;t end up being dominated by the likes of Facebook and Twitter). I chose to only look at startups founded that year, for example. And I decided I wasn&#8217;t going to deem &#8220;the top&#8221; simply based on which had the most investment dollars or user numbers or Techcrunch headlines. &#8220;Mary, Mary, quite contrary&#8230;&#8221; I know. But I wanted to identify the startups that represented important or interesting tech trends and that represented them well.</p>

<p>When I started picking the Top Ed-Tech Startups here on Hack Education, I kept those rules. I wanted to select startups that were <em>good</em>. And in education technology that&#8217;s easier said than done.</p>

<p>Indeed each year, it&#8217;s become harder and harder to pick ten startups. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/21/top-10-ed-tech-startups-of-2012">In 2012</a>, four of the entities on my list weren&#8217;t startups at all. I chose one non-profit, one university initiative, one MOOC, and one Kickstarter project. Last year, I only came up with three names, two of which I&#8217;d featured in previous years. </p>

<p>My rules have crumbled, as has my interest &#8211; or hell, even belief &#8211; in ed-tech startups.</p>

<p>Despite the mythology of &#8220;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/05/24/disruptive-innovation">disruptive innovation</a>,&#8221; the most innovative initiatives in education technology <em>aren&#8217;t</em> coming from startups. They aren&#8217;t incubated in Silicon Valley. They don&#8217;t emerge from the tech industry. In fact, many of the ed-tech startup ideas that are developed there are at best laughable, at worst horrifying. </p>

<p>What I like instead: the <a href="http://dp.la">Digital Public Library of America</a>, <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a>, <a href="http://umw.domains/">A Domain of One&#8217;s Own</a>, <a href="http://p2pu.org/">P2PU</a>, and <a href="http://lumenlearning.com/">Lumen Learning</a>, for example.</p>

<p>I started to write &#8220;the top ed-tech startups of 2014 are NULL,&#8221; but that&#8217;s unfair. <em>My work</em> has changed; I look at <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2014/12/21/frequently-asked-questions">a lot fewer startups these days</a>. There are other publications that do &#8211; often, unfortunately, with little discernment. <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2012/what-silicon-valley-gets-wrong-about-math-education-again-and-again/">Discerning educators</a> offer a lot more insight, I&#8217;d argue.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>But the best edtech I saw in 2014 (<a href="https://twitter.com/getClasskick">@getClasskick</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PearDeck">@PearDeck</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Desmos">@Desmos</a>) was good because it knew when to put the tech on the bench.</p>&mdash; Dan Meyer (@ddmeyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/ddmeyer/status/545750495092940800">December 19, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Echoing Dan Meyer, I&#8217;ll give <a href="https://www.peardeck.com/"><strong>Pear Deck</strong></a> a shout-out as one of the top ed-tech startups of the year. (It fits my rules: it was founded in 2014.) Pear Deck allows educators to make interactive presentations and assessments &#8211; what <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2014/tools-for-socialized-instruction-not-individualized-instruction/">Meyer has described</a> as &#8220;the <em>opposite</em> of individualized instruction. It's socialized instruction.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I&#8217;ll also give another &#8220;top ed-tech startup&#8221; nod to <a href="https://withknown.com/"><strong>Known</strong></a>. As part of the fledgling <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/indie.html">Indie Web Movement</a>, Known launched this year and offers the ability to <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/09/11/indieweb-advocates-launch-known-so-bloggers-can-be-social-and-still-control-their-content/">control your content</a> and your data &#8211; to publish on your own site and syndicate everywhere. As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/05/22/alberta-digital-learning-forum">argued</a> repeatedly, I hope that we&#8217;ll see more of these efforts to &#8220;reclaim&#8221; education technology for learners, by learners so that ed-tech is not simply about industry and institutional data mining and surveillance.</p>

<p>So there. I picked <strong>two</strong> top ed-tech startups for 2014: Known and Pear Deck.</p>

<p>Looking for other ways to rank the year's top startups? </p>

<p>* Actually this is really tough to gauge, and this list is pretty flawed. Are these unique users? Are they monthly active users? It seems like &#8220;10 million users&#8221; is the threshhold for when you issue a press release about your numbers -- unless you insist you&#8217;re on a path to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2014/09/30/with-40-million-in-new-cash-teacher-student-app-remind-targets-a-billion-users-worldwide/">1 billion users</a>, which I guess investors believe enough to put you on the list of top funded startups for the year. And that makes you &#8220;the top&#8221; for sure.</p>

<p>Of course, none of these numbers - users, dollars, pageviews, mentions - means jack shit when it comes to how technology companies might reshape or enhance learning, but hey. "Learning" - that's one of <em>my</em> rules about what makes a &#8220;top ed-tech startup,&#8221; not necessarily the industry&#8217;s.</p>
