<h2>The Death of an Adjunct</h2>
<p>&ldquo;On Sept. 1, <strong>Margaret Mary Vojtko</strong>, an adjunct professor who had taught French at <strong>Duquesne University</strong> for 25 years, passed away at the age of 83,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/opinion/perspectives/death-of-an-adjunct-703773/">writes Daniel Kovalik</a>. &ldquo;She had just been let go from her job as a professor at Duquesne, that she was given no severance or retirement benefits, and that the reason she was having trouble taking care of herself was because she was living in extreme poverty.&rdquo; Shame on Duquesne University. Shame on the whole university system that increasingly relies on adjunct labor. Shame on a country that does not believe in universal health insurance and a living wage for all.</p>
<h2>MOOCs</h2>
<p><strong>EdX</strong> launched a new program, &ldquo;<a href="http://mitopencourseware.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/mitx-introduces-xseries-course-sequence-certificates-on-edx/">the XSeries</a>,&rdquo; that will offer certificates for students who complete a sequence of classes offered on its MOOC platform. The program starts with two series: Foundations of Computer Science and Supply Chain and Logistics Management. These new certificates will require an ID verification program, newly launched from edX too.

<p>The UK MOOC consortium <strong>FutureLearn</strong> officially opened its doors this week, with 20 upcoming <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">classes</a> on the schedule.

<h2>Elsewhere&hellip; On Campus</h2>
<p><strong>The Minerva Project</strong>, a for-profit education startup that promises it will offer an &ldquo;elite&rdquo; education, revealed its <a href="http://minerva.kgi.edu/admissions/">tuition prices</a> this week: $10,000 per year. That figure does not include other expenses like textbooks and room-and-board. That&rsquo;ll run you about $28,850 per year. Applications for the inaugural class, starting Fall 2014, are due at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Faculty at <strong>Penn State</strong> objected to a new health plan that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/business/on-campus-a-faculty-uprising-over-personal-data.html">requires</a> &ldquo;nonunion employees, like professors and clerical staff members, to visit their doctors for a checkup, undergo several biometric tests and submit to an extensive online health risk questionnaire that asks, among other questions, whether they have recently had problems with a co-worker, a supervisor or a divorce. If they don&rsquo;t fill out the form, $100 a month will be deducted from their pay for noncompliance.&rdquo; The story hit The New York Times; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/09/19/penn-state-backs-down-health-insurance-requirements-set-faculty-revolt">the administration backed down</a>.</p>

<h2>Education Politics</h2>

<p>The <strong>US Department of Education</strong> has issued guidelines on how to handle the &ldquo;double-testing&rdquo; that might arise from the requirements for <strong>NCLB</strong> testing along with the new <strong>CCSS</strong> assessments. <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2013/09/us_ed_department_issues_guidan.html">According to Education Week</a>, this will give states &ldquo;the chance to suspend their current tests this spring, as long as they administer field tests being designed by the two common-assessment consortia in math and English/language arts.&rdquo;</p>

The examination scrutinized more than 100 testing failures and reviewed statistics on each of nearly 93,000 test questions given to students nationwide. The reporting revealed vulnerabilities at every step of the testing process. It exposed significant cracks in a cornerstone of one of the most sweeping pieces of federal legislation to target American schools: The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>PARCC</strong> has put out an <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2013/09/parcc_consortium.html">RFP</a> for a technology platform to be used to deliver its new Common Core State Standards assessments and build a data management and reporting system for them.

<p>Layoffs at <strong>Blackboard</strong>, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/09/blackboard-layoffs.html">reports The Washington Business Journal</a>.
