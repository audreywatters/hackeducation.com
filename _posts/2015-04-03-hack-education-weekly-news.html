<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p>11 Atlanta educators were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/us/verdict-reached-in-atlanta-school-testing-trial.html">convicted</a> of racketeering this week for their role in the Atlanta Public Schools&#8217; cheating scandal. They face 20 years in prison. (Other educators <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/04/10/176784631/el-paso-schools-cheating-scandal-probes-officials-accountability">charged similar crimes</a> elsewhere have been charged with fraud and forgery, and their sentences have been <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_27416143/former-episd-administrator-sentenced-five-years-supervised-probation">nowhere near as long</a> as those faced in this case.) Sentencing for the Atlanta educators is April 8 &#8211; they were led out of the courtroom in handcuffs and will remain in jail until their sentencing. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/21/wrong-answer">This New Yorker article</a> from last year paints the best picture, I think, about the pressures &#8211; political, administrative, and so on &#8211; in the district.</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court ruled that GPS trackers are a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/supreme-court-if-youre-being-gps-tracked-youre-being-searched/389114/">form of search and seizure</a>, and as such could violate the Fourth Amendment. <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-03-28-connecting-the-classroom-with-the-internet-of-things">But hey, let&#8217;s hook students up to the Internet of Things!!</a></p>

<br />
<p>Politico reports that the <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0415/morningeducation17724.html">student data privacy bill</a> is &#8220;in limbo.&#8221; The draft of the bill was withdrawn after it &#8220;drew fierce criticism from both parent activists (who deemed it too weak) and ed-tech lobbyists (who viewed it as too tough).&#8221;</p>

<p>The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/03/nyregion/new-york-city-consumer-agency-investigating-four-for-profit-colleges.html">investigating</a> Berkeley College, Mandl School, and New York Career Institute and Technical Career Institutes over its recruiting practices and its students&#8217; loan default rates.</p>

<p>Education Under Secretary Ted Mitchell and officials from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and the Treasury Department met with student &#8220;debt strikers&#8221; this week.

<p>edX has settled with the Justice Department over charges that its materials were not accessible to the disabled.

As part of the agreement, edX denied it was not in compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act,&#8221; the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/edx-settles-with-justice-dept-over-disability-compliance/96609">Chronicle of Higher Education reports</a>.</p>
