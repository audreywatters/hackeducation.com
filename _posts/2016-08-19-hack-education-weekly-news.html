More details in the for-profit higher ed section below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/new-jersey-legislators-move-to-reform-aggressive-student-loan-program">Via ProPublica</a>: &#8220;<strong>New Jersey</strong> lawmakers have announced a series of measures addressing <strong>student debt</strong> issues this week, including one bill aimed at reforming the state&#8217;s controversial student loan program.&#8221; Currently, the state&#8217;s loan program does not offer any reprieve for borrowers who are unemployed or face financial struggles.</p>

<p>The US Department of Education has <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-ed-launches-initiative-low-income-students-access-new-generation-higher-education-providers">selected</a> eight higher ed institutions and eight &#8220;non-traditional providers&#8221; that will work as partners to pilot the DoE&#8217;s new <strong>EQUIP</strong> experiment, meaning that students will be able to receive <strong>federal financial aid</strong> for <strong>coding bootcamps</strong>, <strong>MOOCs</strong>, and the like. Each partner has a &#8220;quality assurance entity&#8221; (one of which is <strong>Entangled Solutions</strong>, a venture fund run by Paul Freedman, who was <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/08/29/altius-releases-documents-ivy-bridge-college-accreditation-fight">investigated by the Justice Department</a> regarding a partnership between his for-profit company and a university.

<p>&#8220;<strong>Coding Boot Camps</strong> Attract Tech Companies,&#8221; <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/coding-boot-camps-attract-tech-companies-1470945503">says The Wall Street Journal</a> in a story that contains this gem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Google</strong>, which has hired workers from <strong>Flatiron</strong> and other academies, recently studied the efficacy of coding camps. The company found that while the camps have shown promise, most of their graduates weren&#8217;t prepared for software engineering without additional training or prior experience, Maggie Johnson, Google&#8217;s director of education and university relations, said in an email.</p>
