<p>A <a href="http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/55836239-story">bill</a> in Florida would allow students to substitute computer science for the foreign language graduation requirement. (A terrible idea.)</p>

Antonin Scalia said he thought African American students should be kept out of the university and be poised towards a &#8220;less advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well.&#8221; He&#8217;s wrong on &#8220;<a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/10/9885594/scalia-affirmative-action-mismatch">mismatch</a>.&#8221; Scientific American columnist Danielle N.

The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce also <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/12/prweb13126190.htm">weighed in</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;More than 100 students involved in a sexting scandal at a southern Colorado high school will not face criminal charges,&#8221; <a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/12/09/prosecutors-no-charges-in-canon-city-high-school-sexting-case/">says the Fremont County DA</a>.</p>
