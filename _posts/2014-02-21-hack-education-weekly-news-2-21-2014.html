<h2>Law and Politics</h2>
<p><strong>Michael Dunn</strong> was convicted on three counts of attempted murder but was found not guilty of killing <strong>Jordan Davis</strong>, the 17 year old African-American who Dunn shot and killed in November 2012 over a dispute about Davis&rsquo;s loud music. The shooting and the verdict, both in <strong>Florida</strong>, were very reminiscent of George Zimmerman&rsquo;s killing of Trayvon Martin. A group of educators and activists (myself included) pulled together <a href="http://practicaltheory.org/blog/2014/02/17/teaching-about-the-jordan-davis-murder/">a guide</a> of sorts to help teachers address this in their classrooms.</p>
<p>The <strong>FCC</strong> <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/quickwire-fcc-promises-new-rules-to-ensure-net-neutrality/50615">promises</a> that it will work to safeguard <strong>net neutrality</strong>. Mmmhmmm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Google</strong> is expanding its high speed internet service, Google Fiber, to <a href="https://fiber.google.com/newcities/">34 new cities</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/us/lawsuit-accuses-for-profit-schools-of-fraud.html">The New York Times covers</a> a lawsuit filed against the for-profit education company <strong>Premier Education Group</strong> (which runs, among other things, the Harris School of Business chain). &ldquo;The suit contends that while charging more than $10,000 for programs lasting less than a year, school officials routinely misled students about their career prospects, and falsified records to enroll them and keep them enrolled, so that government grant and loan dollars would keep flowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>President Obama</strong> apologized (with a handwritten note to <strong>art history</strong> professor Ann Collins Johns) for his anti-art history-major remarks. Florida Senator (and is it too early to say Presidential hopeful?) <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> <a href="http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/02/marco-rubio-takes-strong-stance-against-art-history-majors/358255/">called</a> the apology &ldquo;pathetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The US Department of Education has <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-awards-nine-states-continue-efforts-turn-aroun">awarded</a> 9 states <strong>School Improvement Grants</strong>: Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The funds are aimed at &ldquo;turning around&rdquo; low-performing schools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Missouri</strong>&rsquo;s proposed budget includes billions of dollars for schools, millions more for scholarships and $8 for tin foil hats&rdquo; <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2014/02/19/4834803/in-a-jab-at-common-core-opponents.html">for those paranoid about the <strong>Common Core</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Continuing to demonstrate its awfulness, a <a href="http://www.kansas.com/2014/02/18/3297077/sponsor-of-kansas-spanking-bill.html">proposed bill</a> in <strong>Kansas</strong> would ease the state&rsquo;s restrictions on <strong>spanking</strong> &ldquo;allowing parents, caregivers or school officials to hit children hard enough to leave redness or bruising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <strong>California</strong>, State Senator Darrell Steinberg has <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/technology/scrutiny-in-california-for-software-in-schools.html">proposed</a> a <strong>data privacy</strong> bill that would &ldquo;prohibit education-related websites, online services and mobile apps for kindergartners through 12th graders from compiling, using or sharing the personal information of those students in California for any reason other than what the school intended or for product maintenance.&rdquo;</p>

He&rsquo;s declared his intention to release his printer &ndash; which costs about $350, much less than traditional $2000+ Braille printers &ndash; as open source hardware so that it can be improved by a wider developer community.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>PBS&rsquo;s MediaShift</strong> has <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/mediashift-launches-educationshift-with-knight-scripps-college-support">launched</a> a new journalism education site, <strong>EducationShift</strong>. &ldquo;The new site will include increased coverage of innovation in the classroom as journalism and communications schools around the globe are coping with massive technological change &mdash; both for classroom learning and for graduates in the workforce.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-02-19-uk-s-edtech-incubator-graduates-first-class-of-teacherpreneurs">Edsurge has the list</a> of the first cohort of London-based education accelerator &ldquo;<strong>Edtech Incubator</strong>.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re all &ldquo;teacherpreneurs,&rdquo; apparently, which let&rsquo;s be honest, is the worst word in education technology buzzword land.</p>

<h2>MOOOOOOOOCs</h2>
<p>The <strong>University of Tokyo</strong> has <a href="http://mitopencourseware.wordpress.com/2014/02/18/university-of-tokyo-joins-edx/">joined</a> <strong>edX</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Harvard</strong> and <strong>MIT</strong> have <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/harvard-and-mit-release-visualization-tools-for-trove-of-mooc-data/50631">released</a> visualizations (and open sourced the visualization tools) on their MOOC data.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MOOCs are proving to be a great tool for employee training,&rdquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg/status/435864375958577153">tweeted</a> <strong>Coursera</strong> co-founder Andrew Ng (a little bit of a different message than &ldquo;democratizing higher education.&rdquo; But there ya go.)</p>
<p>And speaking of &ldquo;democratizing higher education lulz,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/21/elite-universities-face-lower-stakes-familiar-concerns-mooc-space">Inside Higher Ed looks at</a>&nbsp;what <strong>Cornell</strong>, <strong>Princeton</strong>, and <strong>Yale</strong> think about MOOCs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first British massive open online course to offer students the option to pay for <strong>academic credit</strong> has ended, with none of its participants opting to fork out for official recognition,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/20/british-mooc-first-country-give-option-paying-credit-gets-no-takers">writes the Times Higher Education</a>. Nice lede. Important detail: the class was on Vampire Fictions, which probably isn&rsquo;t something folks are clamoring for formal recognition of, ya know.</p>
<p>It looks as though there&rsquo;s growing interest in using MOOCs to teach <strong>AP</strong> classes.&nbsp;<a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/02/20/u-houston-system-intros-free-ap-exam-prep-and-teacher-training-moocs.aspx">According to Campus Technology</a>, &ldquo;The <strong>University of Houston System</strong> is launching its first three massive open online courses (MOOCs), two of them targeted to high school seniors preparing for advanced placements tests and one for K&ndash;12 teachers. The classes will be offered free through <strong>Coursera</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paging physics teachers: join a MOOC to build a MOOC on introductory physics course. This course is being organized by <strong>Dave Cormier</strong>, so it&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://davecormier.com/edblog/2014/02/17/building-an-introductory-physics-course-cmooc-meets-xmooc/">cMOOC meets xMOOC</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Money and Markets</h2>
<p>English-language learning site <strong>TutorGroup</strong> has raised $100 million in funding from Alibaba, Temasek and Qiming Venture Partners, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/16/alibaba-others-sink-100m-into-asias-language-learning-service-tutorgroup-exclusive/">reports VentureBeat</a>.</p>
<p>Tokyo-based <strong>Smart Education</strong> has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-02-19-tokyo-educational-app-developer-scores-5m">raised</a> $5 million from CyberAgent and Infinity Venture Partners.</p>
<p><strong>NewSchools Venture Fund</strong> has raised another $12 million for its <a href="http://www.newschools.org/blog/seed-fund">seed fund</a>, which in turn funds education technology startups.</p>
<p><strong>Uniquedu</strong>, a company that&rsquo;s described as &ldquo;China&rsquo;s Coursera-style online education portal,&rdquo; has <a href="http://www.ecampusnews.com/around-the-web/chinese-coursera-style-education-portal-scores-16-5-million-funding/">raised</a> $16.5 million in funding.</p>
<p>Google Capital, a VC arm of Google, has <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-02-19-google-capital-pumps-40m-in-renaissance-learning">invested</a> $40 million into <strong>Renaissance Learning</strong>, maker of Accelerated Reader and Accelerated Math.</p>
<p><strong>Duolingo</strong> has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/18/duolingo-raises-20m-series-c-round-led-by-kleiner-perkins-wants-to-dominate-online-language-learning/">raised</a> $20 million from Kleiner Perkins.

<p><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/chgg"><strong>Chegg</strong>&rsquo;s shares</a> have fallen sharply (more than 22% last Friday) in recent weeks. <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/02/14/why-chegg-inc-shares-crashed.aspx">According to The Motley Fool</a>, &ldquo;investors are understandably upset&rdquo; about the company&rsquo;s margins.</p>
<p>Online education platform <strong>2U</strong> has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/21/us-2u-ipo-idUSBREA1K23O20140221">filed</a> the initial paperwork for an IPO. (Hopefully its stock will perform better than Chegg&rsquo;s!)</p>
<p>The big acquisition news this week wasn&rsquo;t in education. It was <strong>Facebook</strong>&rsquo;s $19 billion <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/140220/p55#a140220p55">purchase</a> of the mobile messaging app <strong>WhatsApp</strong>. There probably is something to think here for edu folks about the importance of mobile, messaging, developing world markets, and young users. Also worth thinking about: $19 billion is more than the annual budget for NASA, more than the UN&rsquo;s aid budget, more than twice the annual budget for HeadStart, and more than 40 times the annual budget for PBS.</p>
<h2>From the HR Department</h2>
<p>Who gives a damn about the so-called STEM worker shortage &ndash; there is a looming <strong><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/exclusive-national-clown-shortage-approaching-article-1.1616801">clown shortage</a></strong>!!</p>

<p>The <strong>Hewlett Foundation</strong> funded a study, published by <a href="http://gettingsmart.com/">GettingSmart</a> (the consulting site of investor Tom Vander Ark), that examines the cost-savings associated with <strong>robo-grading</strong>.
