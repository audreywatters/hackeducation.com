<p>CIPA requires schools that receive federal <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/learnnet/">E-rate</a> funding filter their networks.  But what happens when schools provide students with computers for one-to-one programs?  Should that same filtering extend to students' Internet access at home?</p>
<p>Different schools have different policies about this, so I asked the FCC for clarification on this.  Read my story over on <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/10/when-school-web-filtering-comes-home/">MindShift</a> for the agency's response.</p>
