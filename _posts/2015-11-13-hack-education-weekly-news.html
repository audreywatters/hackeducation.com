<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p>&#8220;In Swan Song, Arne Duncan Extols School Progress Under His Tenure,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/us/in-swan-song-arne-duncan-extols-school-progress-under-his-tenure.html">says The New York Times</a>. Part of that song: the Department of Education boasted what Race to the Top has done for schools in a new <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/RTT%20Final%20Report.pdf">76-page report</a>. <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2015/11/what_the_new_race_to_the_top_r.html">Via Education Week</a>: &#8220;What the Ed. Dept.&#8217;s New Race to the Top Report Reveals, and What It Avoids.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the heels of the Department of Education&#8217;s announcement that it&#8217;s going to experiment with letting students get financial aid for taking courses at MOOCs and bootcamps (<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-09-equipped-for-equip-here-s-a-primer">here&#8217;s a &#8220;primer&#8221; on the policy by Edsurge</a>), consulting firm Entangled Solutions says that it&#8217;s going to apply to become a &#8220;quality-assurance entity.&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/11/12/upstart-auditor-boot-camp-experiment">Inside Higher Ed has the details</a>, but misses this key one: Entangled Solutions is run by Paul Freedman, whose company Altius Education had its &#8220;experiment&#8221; at Bridge College at Tiffin University <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/08/05/tiffin-u-drops-ivy-bridge-college-partnership-altius-over-accreditors-concerns">shut down by an accreditor</a> over concerns about outsourcing and quality control. God, this bootcamp thing is going to be a fucking disaster. Well done, Department of Ed. Well done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, &#8220;<a href="http://www.psmag.com/politics-and-law/the-department-of-education-demands-greater-accountability-from-college-accreditors">The Department of Education Demands Greater Accountability From College Accreditors</a>.&#8221; /headdesk</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/11/10/9704420/hillary-clinton-charter-schools">Hillary Clinton said something critical about charter schools</a> while on the campaign trail, and considering the blowback, it&#8217;s a nice reminder of why most of the Democrats just keep their mouths shut on education policy.</p>

<p>Of course, the Republican candidates might do well to keep their mouths shut too. <a href="http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-education/2015/11/duncan-visits-sig-school-working-college-students-rubio-says-clinton-captive-to-unions-211240">This gem from Ben Carson</a>: &#8220;We know that the very best education is homeschool. The next is private school. The next is charter schools. And the last is public schools.&#8221; Homeschooled neurosurgeons FTW.</p>

<p><a href="http://laschoolreport.com/a-year-later-secrecy-surrounds-fbi-probe-of-lausds-ipad-program/">Via the LA School Report</a>: &#8220;A year later, secrecy surrounds FBI probe of LAUSD's iPad program.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Newark was V1 of our education work,&#8217;&#8217; <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-09/six-questions-for-mark-zuckerberg-on-science-giving-and-facebook-s-role-in-health">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Bloomberg</a>. &#8221;And so now we&#8217;re onto V2.&quot; Move fast and break things&#8230;</p>

<h3>Education in the Courts</h3>
<br />
<p>The University of Illinois has paid <a href="http://academeblog.org/2015/11/12/university-of-illinois-pays-875000-to-settle-salaita-case/">$875,000</a> to settle Steven Salaita&#8217;s lawsuit, resulting from the school&#8217;s decision to fire Salaita based on comments he made on Twitter about Palestine.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Phi Kappa Psi fraternity chapter at the University of Virginia filed a $25 million lawsuit Monday against Rolling Stone magazine, which published an article in 2014 that alleged a freshman was gang raped at the house during a party,&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/11/09/phi-psi-chapter-at-u-va-files-25-million-lawsuit-against-rolling-stone/?wprss=rss_education">The Washington Post reports</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/court-docs-show-a-university-helped-fbi-bust-silk-road-2-child-porn-suspects">Via Motherboard</a>: &#8220;Court Docs Show a University Helped FBI Bust Silk Road 2, Child Porn Suspects.&#8221; That university: Carnegie Mellon. To help the FBI, researchers there attacked the Tor network, a system that helps anonymize Internet traffic. How did CMU IRB approve this, eh?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/nyregion/guilty-plea-in-drug-overdoses-at-wesleyan.html">Via The New York Times</a>: &#8220;A former Wesleyan University student pleaded guilty on Thursday to a federal drug dealing charge, admitting that he had distributed a party drug that left nearly a dozen students hospitalized, two in critical condition, after they overdosed on the drug last winter.&#8221;</p>

<h3>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h3>
<br />
<p>Udacity has raised <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/11/udacity-raises-105-million-series-d-bringing-valuation-to-1-billion/#.tcahar:unLP">$105 million</a>. It&#8217;s now valued at $1 billion, which means the tech sector congratulates it as a &#8220;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-11-udacity-grows-a-horn">unicorn</a>.&#8221; Investing in this round: Bertelsmann, Baillie Gifford, Emerson Collective, Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Charles River Ventures, and Drive Capital. The startup has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/udacity">$160 million</a> total. <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/11/12/new-funding-udacity-valued-1-billion">More via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>

<p>When Fortune writes &#8220;<a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/04/ed-tech-at-fortune-global-forum-2015/">Why Ed Tech Is Currently &#8216;The Wild Wild West&#8217;</a>&#8221; the answer it offers is not &#8220;because it&#8217;s dominated by imperialism and white male supremacy.&#8221; Why, it's almost like these people don't read my work at all. Anyway, I guess there was a Fortune-run panel at a Fortune-run conference where Daphne Koller weighed in on MOOCs, and other panelists made predictions about the coming demise of universities.</p>

<p>Open University is investing <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=29550">Â£13 million</a> more in FutureLearn. <a href="http://followersoftheapocalyp.se/a-brief-note-on-futurelearn-finance/">Via David Kernohan</a>: &#8220;A brief note on FutureLearn finance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better Residential Learning Is The True Innovation of MOOCs,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/better-residential-learning-true-innovation-moocs">IHE blogger Joshua Kim contends</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both Sides Of The Education Debate Are United In Scorn For Online Charter Schools,&#8221; <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/both-sides-of-the-education-debate-are-united-in-scorn-for-o#.ge13461O3">says Buzzfeed&#8217;s Molly Hensley-Clancy</a> (although I&#8217;m never sure what &#8220;both sides&#8221; really means as I find myself at odds with &#8220;both.&#8221;)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a pretty familiar promise in for-profit education: &#8220;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/11/blocs-guarantee-get-a-job-as-a-programmer-or-your-money-back/">Bloc&#8217;s Guarantee: Get a Job as a Programmer or Your Money Back</a>.&#8221; (Bloc charges $24,000 for a 48-week online &#8220;coding bootcamp.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;The Starbucks Corporation this week announced that it will offer a tuition-free education to a spouse or child of its employees who are veterans or active-duty members of the U.S. military,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/11/10/starbucks-extends-military-tuition-benefit">Inside Higher Ed reports</a>. (That is, tuition-free education at ASU Online as part of Starbucks&#8217; existing deal with the school.)</p>

ITT Educational Services, which filed its third quarter results on Friday, reported a 16 percent revenue decrease and similar drop in enrollment for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared to the same period in 2014. DeVry disclosed a total revenue decrease of 4.5 percent, or about $441 million, for the same period . Strayer&#8217;s revenues fell 2 percent to about $99 million. And as we reported last month, Apollo made about $600 million in the quarter ending Aug. 31, compared to $696 million in the fourth quarter 2014. But Capella reported a third-quarter revenue of nearly $104 million, up from about $103 million in the same three months last year. And its enrollment increased over 4 percent.&#8221; But I'm sure bootcamps are gonna be terrific.</p>
