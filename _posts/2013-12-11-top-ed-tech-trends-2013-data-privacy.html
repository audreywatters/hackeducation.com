<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Part 7 of my <a href="http://2013trends.hackeducation.com">Top 10 Ed-Tech Trends of 2013</a> series</em></p>
<p>This is the third year in a row that I've chosen "data" as one of the "top trends" in ed-tech. (See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/12/16/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2011-data-which-still-means-mostly-standardized-testing">2011</a>, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/09/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-education-data-and-learning-analytics">2012</a>) If you're looking for a sunnier view of data in education, read those. 2013, in my opinion, was pretty grim.</p>

<h3>Edward Snowden: Not TIME Person of the Year</h3>
<br />
<p>TIME Magazine announced its Person of the Year this morning: <a href="http://poy.time.com/2013/12/11/person-of-the-year-pope-francis-the-peoples-pope/">Pope Francis</a>. He seems like a pretty swell guy, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. But many folks have argued it&rsquo;s a dull even cowardly decision by the magazine. (Of course, its other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year">recent selections</a> include Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, Ben Bernanke, and Mark Zuckerberg. TIME is not really known for bold choices, let&rsquo;s be honest).</p>

<p>The appropriate choice for Person of the Year, <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/snowden-for-person-of-the-year-and-coverage-of-a-story-that-just-wont-quit/?smid=tw-share">some argue</a>, would be Edward Snowden, who along with the journalist Glenn Greenwald, is certainly responsible for the most important story of the year: revelations about widespread government surveillance by the National Security Agency &ndash; the collection of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations-worldwide-snowden-documents-show/2013/12/04/5492873a-5cf2-11e3-bc56-c6ca94801fac_story.html">massive</a> amounts of data from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">telephone</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">technology companies</a>. &ldquo;Email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP chats, file transfers, social networking details, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">and more</a>&rdquo; siphoned from Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, Skype, AOL, and others. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/the_nsa_is_brea.html">Encryption undermined</a>. <a href="http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/11/23/nsa-infected-50000-computer-networks-with-malicious-software/">Malware spread</a>. <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/9/28/nsa-uses-complexwebstotrackamericans.html">Our social connections mapped</a>. Warrantless spying by governments (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-29/french-intelligence-involved-in-nsa-spying-in-france-monde-says.html">not only by the US&rsquo;s</a>) &ndash; not just on suspected terrorists, but on all of us.</p>

<p>Interestingly I heard very little outcry from ed-tech proponents about the troubling implications of NSA surveillance via the technologies that are being pushed in schools, about the impact that this might have on students&rsquo; privacy, &ndash; <a href="http://funnymonkey.com/blog/how-are-schools-using-apple-google-microsoft-and-facebook-explaining-surveillance">hardly a peep</a> from those who have gone &ldquo;all in&rdquo; with Google Apps or iPads or YouTube for Schools or Skype in the Classroom or Facebook.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that there weren&rsquo;t any red flags raised this year about data collection, data mining, and privacy. But often, these were concerns about <em>corporations&lsquo;</em> use of student data and not governments&rsquo;. The Snowden revelations should serve as a reminder that the two are inseparable.</p>

<p>And perhaps some educators&rsquo; excitement about tools like Google Glass should serve to remind us too that just as an uncritical embrace of &ldquo;ooo! shiny!&rdquo; runs deep in some ed-tech circles, a culture of surveillance runs deep in schools as well.</p>
