<p><a title="Casual Gamer by Brendan Lynch, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/brendanlynch/5015711005"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4124/5015711005_e4905e1f93.jpg" alt="Casual Gamer" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>For the <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/10/10/hack-education-weekly-news-10-10-2014/">second week in a row</a>, I am compelled to open my round-up of education-related stories with news of ongoing harassment and threats against women in technology. This week, it's a look at <strong>#Gamergate</strong>, which has been going on for months now, but this week escalated to new levels.</p>
<p>Cultural critic <strong>Anita Sarkeesian</strong> was <a href="http://www.usu.edu/ust/index.cfm?article=54178">forced</a> to cancel a speaking engagement at <strong>Utah State University</strong>. Because of a Utah law, campus officials told her that they could not stop attendees from bringing concealed weapons into her talk &mdash; even though the campus had received a threat from someone calling himself Marc L&eacute;pine and promising "the deadliest school shooting in American history" if Sarkeesian spoke. (L&eacute;pine was the man who, in 1989, killed 14 women at &Eacute;cole Polytechnique, an engineering school in Montreal, Quebec.)</p>
<p>Also chased from her home this week: game developer <strong>Brianna Wu</strong>. Someone posted her address on Twitter, then threatened her with rape and murder. (<a href="http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/brianna-wu-gamergate">Here&rsquo;s her first person account</a>.)</p>
<p>I wrote about this as &ldquo;<a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-29/">What You Should Know This Week</a>&rdquo; over on Educating Modern Learners (free subscription required.) And <strong>I <em>insist</em> that this is an education technology issue.</strong> I received some pushback on Twitter last night (from men, go figure) when I made this assertion and asked why ed-tech publications have been so silent on the topic of this ongoing campaign of threats and harassment against women.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an education technology issue, in part, because of the expectations that we all are supposed interact online &ndash; for profession, personal, and academic purposes. What does that look like for girls and women? You can&rsquo;t just tell us to &ldquo;not read the comments&rdquo; when the threats against us escalate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an education technology issue because women like Sarkeesian and <strong>Kathy Sierra</strong> (who I <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/10/10/hack-education-weekly-news-10-10-2014/">wrote about last week</a>) <em>are educators</em> (in gaming and in tech respectively).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an education technology issue because we must address <strong>the culture of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">meritocracy</span> misogyny</strong> that permeates so much of the technology industry, particularly as we bring more and more of its products, services, engineers, entrepreneurs, and ideology into education.</p>
<p>That so many men in ed-tech continue to minimize the experiences of harassment and violence against women in ed-tech is pretty telling about whose values and whose risks are being hard-coded into the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Duly noted.</p>
<p>And in other news&hellip;</p>
<h2>Education Law and Politics</h2>
<p><strong>Karen Lewis</strong> <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/10/10/hack-education-weekly-news-10-10-2014/">announced</a> last week that she was stepping down as the head of the Chicago Teachers Union, and this week, she <a href="http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/karen-lewis-has-brain-tumor-not-running-mayor/mon-10132014-501pm">confirmed</a> that she will not run for Chicago mayor because she&rsquo;s suffering from a brain tumor. Get well soon, Karen.</p>
<p><strong>LAUSD</strong> will <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/10/los_angeles_school_board_rejects_releasing_apple_procurement_report.html">not release</a> an inspector general&rsquo;s report into the district&rsquo;s decision-making process that went into its massive purchase of <strong>iPads</strong> and <strong>Pearson</strong> curriculum. The school board voted 4&ndash;3 against releasing the information to the public.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/16/us-trump-nyag-lawsuit-idUSKCN0I52MW20141016">Via Reuters</a> (which has a great photo to accompany this story, I must say): &ldquo;<strong>Donald Trump</strong> is personally liable for operating a <strong>for-profit investment school</strong> without the required license, a <strong>New York</strong> judge ruled in a lawsuit brought by the New York Attorney General against the real estate entrepreneur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in other celebrity-related education news: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/on/alex-trebek-wordsmart-education-program-false-advertising-ftc/"><strong>Alex Trebek</strong>-Endorsed Education Program Duped Parents, FTC Says</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <strong>Michigan</strong> Department of Education is letting schools <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/10/michigan_offers_to_waive_onlin_1.html">request waivers</a> if they aren&rsquo;t technologically prepared to offer assessments online. The schools will be allowed to use <strong>pencil-and-paper exams</strong> for one more year.</p>
<p><strong>Texas</strong> is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/11155993/Pearsons-dominance-of-textbook-market-is-under-examination.html">weighing</a> whether or not to renew its testing contract with <strong>Pearson</strong>. &ldquo;Texas is amongst America&rsquo;s biggest and most influential states when it comes to education spending &ndash; the linchpin in the North American market, which accounts for 59pc of Pearson&rsquo;s revenues and 66pc of its profits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baker Mitchell is a politically connected <strong>North Carolina</strong> businessman who celebrates the power of the free market. Every year, millions of public education dollars flow through Mitchell&rsquo;s chain of four nonprofit <strong>charter schools</strong> to for-profit companies he controls.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/charter-school-power-broker-turns-public-education-into-private-profits">Read the whole story on ProPublica</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/bobby_jindal_wont_apply_for_pr.html"><strong>Louisiana</strong></a> &ldquo;Gov. Bobby Jindal will likely block Louisiana from applying for a $15 million federal preschool grant that could help poor children in Louisiana because of concerns the money is tied to the <strong>Common Core</strong> academic standards.&rdquo; You know, for the sake of the children.</p>
<h2>EBOLA!!!!!!</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/us/obama-may-name-ebola-czar-after-amber-joy-vinson-flight-causes-concern.html">Some schools</a> were closed in <strong>Texas</strong> and <strong>Ohio</strong> due to the <strong>Ebola</strong> scare because if there&rsquo;s one thing Americans do well it&rsquo;s overreact to cable news and misconstrue science. I mean, FFS, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/nyregion/fear-of-vaccines-goes-viral.html">folks aren&rsquo;t immunizing their children</a> against polio or measles but we&rsquo;re gonna close schools because of Ebola?!</p>
<p>In <strong>Pennsylvania</strong>, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/10/west_african_teen_taunted_with_chants_of_ebola_at_pa_high_school_soccer.html">West African Teen Taunted With Chants of &lsquo;Ebola&rsquo; at High School Soccer Game</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Syracuse University</strong> has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/10/17/syracuse-u-withdraws-invitation-over-ebola-fears">withdrawn</a> its invitation to Pulitzer Prize winning photojournalist Michel du Cille to speak on campus because he&rsquo;s been in <strong>Liberia</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Navarro College</strong> in <strong>Texas</strong> reportedly turned down an application from a student from Nigeria, <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/culture/health-culture/texas-college-ebola/">according to Vocativ</a>, &ldquo;writing that it&rsquo;s not accepting international students &ldquo;from countries with confirmed Ebola cases.&rdquo; The school has responded saying that some students &rdquo;students &ldquo;received incorrect information regarding their applications to the institution" and it&rsquo;s actually not recruiting students from anywhere in <strong>Africa</strong>. Oh. That clears things right up.</p>
<h2>MOOCs and UnMOOCs</h2>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> is <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/coursera-expands-its-mooc-certificate-program/54915">expanding</a> its <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/100079843217/introducing-18-new-specializations-in-high-demand">Specializations</a> program, which sells students special certificates if they pass multiple MOOCs. Specializations include Data Science, Data Mining, Cybersecurity, and a Virtual Teacher Program. All this is a clue to answer the question &ldquo;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-10-15-how-does-coursera-make-money">How Does Coursera Make Money?</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Real Revolution in Online Education Isn&rsquo;t MOOCs,&rdquo; <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/10/the-real-revolution-in-online-education-isnt-moocs/">says the <strong>Harvard Business Review</strong></a>, which is definitely the publication I trust most to address &ldquo;<strong>real revolution</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/moocs-will-not-transform-education-says-futurelearn-chief/2016379.article">Times Higher Education</a>: &ldquo;Moocs &lsquo;will not transform education&rsquo;, says <strong>FutureLearn</strong> chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But hey, via Marketplace: <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/education/learningcurve/moocs-go-high-school">MOOCs go to <strong>high school</strong></a>.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;in <strong>Texas</strong> political circles, massive open online courses &mdash; commonly known as MOOCs &mdash; have enjoyed a resurgence.&rdquo; More on this exciting development <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2014/10/17/ut-looking-make-more-massive-online-courses/">via the Texas Tribune</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://project.europeanmoocs.eu/first-european-multilingual-moocs-go-live-sign-up-now/">now</a> sign up for the &ldquo;first European Multilingual MOOCs&rdquo; on <strong>EMMA</strong>, the European Multilingual MOOC Aggregator.</p>
<p>Via Campus Technology: &ldquo;<a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/10/15/how-southern-new-hampshire-u-develops-650-online-courses-per-year.aspx?m=1">How <strong>Southern New Hampshire U</strong> Develops 650-Plus Online Courses Per Year</a>.&rdquo; In part, like this: &ldquo;All that is designed in-house and built by our production team into <strong>Blackboard</strong>, our LMS. That becomes our one course model &mdash; our master course &mdash; and we then copy that out depending on how many sections are needed for that term. The instructor receives a fully completed course. It is great for us because we can ensure a lot of consistency across our sections.&rdquo; Doesn't sound so great for the instructor or students, but hey.</p>
<h2>Meanwhile on Campus</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Earlier this week a coalition of nearly 20 media organizations&mdash;including the Society of Professional Journalists&mdash;ratcheted up its support for the <strong>Playwickian</strong>&rsquo;s staff,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/10/students-suspended-for-not-using-a-racial-slur/381551/">reports The Atlantic</a>.
