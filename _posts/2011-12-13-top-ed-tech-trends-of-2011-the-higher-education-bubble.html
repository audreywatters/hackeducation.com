<h3>To Uncollege</h3>
<br />
<p>One of the most interesting people I met this year was Dale Stephens. Dale is just 19, but he's an incredibly intelligent and poised young man.</p>

<p>Dale is a college dropout.</p>

<p>He is also a world traveler, a speaker, a <a href="http://thielfoundation.org/index.php">Thiel Foundation scholar</a>, and a soon-to-be Penguin author. Dale has been outspoken this year about his dissatisfaction with college, writing and talking about his decision to drop-out, and his focus instead on self-education, self-actualization, and entrepreneurship. As such, Dale's become a strong voice for some of those his age questioning whether a college degree is really worth it.</p>
<p>I first met Dale <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/02/10/uncollege-can-unschooling-offer-an-alternative-to-a-college-education">back in February</a> when he was still a student at Hendrix College in Arkansas. Back then he told me about his plans to start <a href="http://uncollege.org">Uncollege</a>, which just as the name suggests, would help support students who wanted to pursue alternate education paths, outside the traditional college degree.</p>
<p>Having grown up home schooled (and unschooled), this wasn't Dale's first venture into constructing a personal learning experience. But the bigger challenge no doubt: helping translate that to others.</p>

<p>Then in May, Dale received $100,000 from PayPal co-funder Peter Thiel as part of the Thiel Foundation's "<a href="http://www.thielfellowship.org/">20 Under 20</a>" Fellowship -- $100,000 to drop out of school. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<h3>Peter Thiel's Higher Education Bubble</h3>
<br />
<p>It was a simple opening sentence to one of the most-read articles in the tech industry this year. Simple and true: "Fair warning: This article will piss off a lot of you."</p>
