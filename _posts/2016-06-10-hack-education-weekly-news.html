Pat McCrory to move his lawsuit against the Obama administration and its staunch defense of <strong>transgender student rights</strong> under Title IX to the state&#8217;s Middle District court. The motion to move the case wasn&#8217;t opposed by the Justice Department, which is countersuing McCrory in the state&#8217;s Middle District. But Judge Terrence Boyle in the Eastern District said McCrory&#8217;s lawsuit is in the right place &#8211; the Eastern District is &#8216;the site of the state capitol and where the legislature and governor reside and act,&#8217; he said in an order. The order pretty much guarantees that there will be a two-front battle over North Carolina&#8217;s so-called &#8216;bathroom law&#8217; in two separate federal district courts. Both cases are going before judges who are generally considered conservative.&#8221;</p>
