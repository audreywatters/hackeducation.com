<h3>Education Politics</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/world/africa/south-africa-university-students.html">Via The New York Times</a>: &#8220;Riot police officers and students protesting against tuition increases clashed on Wednesday outside the Parliament building in Cape Town, the latest in a series of student demonstrations that have gripped South Africa this year.&#8221; Following this week&#8217;s protests, South Africa&#8217;s President Jacob Zuma announced he would <a href="http://www.ei-ie.org/en/news/news_details/3769">scrap the plan</a> to raise tuition fees.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in South Africa: &#8220;Students in mainly-black South African townships around Johannesburg and Pretoria are being given shiny new tablet computers as part of the provincial government's ambition to create a &#8216;paperless classroom&#8217;,&#8221; <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21676368-meanwhile-basics-sanitary-lavatories-are-neglected-south-africas-paperless">The Economist reports</a>. &#8220;But the investment in technology is having an unwanted side-effect: it is attracting the attention of criminals. Along with lessons, education officials are issuing tips on how to avoid muggers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Education Secretary Arne Duncan is preparing to unveil a package of proposals aimed at forcing colleges that receive federal money to improve graduation rates and to provide students with job skills,&#8221; <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/arne-duncan-to-launch-crackdown-on-college-accrediting-1445382119?mod=rss_Education">says The Wall Street Journal</a>. <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/10/20/obama-administration-plans-executive-action-higher-education-accreditation">More via Inside Higher Ed</a>.</p>

<p>From a paper titled &#8220;<a href="http://cepa.stanford.edu/content/changing-distributions-how-online-college-classes-alter-student-and-professor-performance#.Vif-lrB2lFs.twitter">Changing Distributions: How Online College Classes Alter Student and Professor Performance</a>&#8221;: &#8220;Using an instrumental variables approach and data from DeVry University, this study finds that, on average, online course-taking reduces student learning by one-third to one-quarter of a standard deviation compared to conventional in-person classes. Taking a course online also reduces student learning in future courses and persistence in college.&#8221;</p>
