            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>Some thoughts on the closure of the coding bootcamps Dev Bootcamp and The Iron Yard, owned by for-profit colleges Kaplan and Apollo Education Group respectively. I'd already labeled bootcamps "the new for-profit higher ed," and so it's interesting to see how the business of teaching programming hasn't really panned out....</p>

            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>As part of my Spencer Fellowship, I'm investigating the networks of investors and entrepreneurs shaping ed-tech policies and products. I've decided to focus on how "personalized learning" has come to dominate the narratives surrounding technology-based education reform. Spoiler alert: one of the organizations driving this is the Gates Foundation, which has spend some $15 billion on education grants since 1998....</p>

              <p>How did ed-tech manage to shift from the work of early, inquiry-based pioneers like Seymour Papert to the kinds of crap we see today?

(We can hope, I'd argue, that it will not be, not just because it's a bad idea practically but because it's a dangerous one politically.)...</p>
