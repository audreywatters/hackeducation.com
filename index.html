            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>Ivanka Trump penned an op-ed in The New York Post last week, arguing "Why we need to start teaching tech in Kindergarten." She's indicated she plans to make ed-tech a focus of her time in the White House. Inside Higher Ed asked some "experts" their thoughts. Mine didn't make it past the editor, so here they are....</p>

              <p>This talk was delivered at MIT for Justin Reich's Comparative Media Studies class "Learning, Media, and Technology." As the opening weeks of the class address histories and theories of learning, I wanted to underscore how things (ideologies, really) get hard-coded into practices and products. I can't believe I gave a talk on SCORM....</p>

              <p>How did ed-tech manage to shift from the work of early, inquiry-based pioneers like Seymour Papert to the kinds of crap we see today?
