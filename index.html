              <p>The MIT Press has agreed to publish <em>Teaching Machines</em>. I&#8217;m excited and thrilled and overwhelmed. I definitely wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do this without the Spencer Fellowship (and without taking Sam Freedman&#8217;s book writing class at the Columbia School of Journalism). Stay tuned for more details (but probably, if I&#8217;m honest, less &#8220;Hack Education&#8221;). </p>

              <p>This was the tenth article in my "end of 2018" series. This one looks at "brain-based education" and "social emotional learning" and other plans for corporate, cognitive education policy. It's the new behaviorism. I'm not Skinner would like the emphasis on emotions. But he'd love it that we're giving up on the quaint idea of "free will."...</p>

              <p>This talk was delivered at the NMC Summer 2017 conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

              <p>2017 marked the eighth year in which I reviewed the most important stories in the ed-tech industry from the previous twelve months. This isn't really a series about "trends," to be honest. It's not a list of products that schools should buy if they want to stay ahead of the innovative curve. Rather, it's a look at what we're told "innovation" will like....</p>
