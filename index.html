              <p>This talk was delivered at MIT for Justin Reich's Comparative Media Studies class "Learning, Media, and Technology." As the opening weeks of the class address histories and theories of learning, I wanted to underscore how things (ideologies, really) get hard-coded into practices and products.

              <p>A response to this weekend's story in The New York Times on "brand ambassadors" and the ethics of education technology marketing. I'm particularly interested in how the teachers featured (and more broadly ed-tech celebrity in general) reflects whiteness and affluence. Who gets to be an "influencer" and why, and to what end?...</p>

              <p>Lots of fun from the Trump Administration, including attacking academic freedom, attacking Title IX, and promoting STEM education. The latter seems like ConnectED 2.0, which was another time that the tech industry promised to "fix education." Much better PR than one would get by merely paying taxes, I guess....</p>
