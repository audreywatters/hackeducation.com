              <p>This talk was delivered at an event at CUNY on "The Labor of Open" -- a gathering of librarians talking about an open education and open publishing initiative at the university. I wanted to talk about how we imagine a technological future of labor and whose work (and what kind of work) is not seen in that framework....</p>

              <p>This is the transcript from the talk I gave at the CUNY Graduate Center. I'm not sure why I agreed to give a talk as I am so swamped with end-of-semester work. I thought initially I'd just talk through the sample chapter I wrote. Instead I revised a previous talk a little and added some of my book-related research....</p>

              <p>A few thoughts from ASU+GSV. I will have much more to say about venture capital and education technology in an upcoming article in The Baffler. So this is really just a companion piece to all my angst-filled tweets. Thank you everyone who's reached out to make sure I'm safe....</p>

            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>This is a book review of Brian Dear's The Friendly Orange Glow, a history of PLATO. Dear has been working on this project for decades, and it shows. It is incredibly well-researched and this "untold history" is deservedly well-told. I use the book here to think about what's become "dogma" -- in computing and in ed-tech more generally....</p>

I cannot believe that in the midst of everything I'm trying to accomplish right now I agreed to give a talk. But I did. There's not much new here. After all, I am pounding out so many other words in other stories. Who listens to any of it, I guess, when the billionaires tell and sell better tales....</p>

              <p>2017 marks the eighth year in which I've reviewed the most important stories in the ed-tech industry from the previous twelve months. This isn't really a series about "trends," to be honest. It's not a list of products that schools should buy if they want to stay ahead of the innovative curve. Rather, it's a look at what we're told "innovation" will like....</p>
