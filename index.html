<p>I&#8217;m making some major changes to Hack Education this year &#8211; and no, not because I&#8217;ve received venture capital and my investors have told me I have to rewrite the publication&#8217;s mission statement again. That&#8217;s a different site you&#8217;re thinking of&#8230;</p>

<p>For a good portion of the year, Hack Education will go dormant. (<a href="http://hackeducation.com/archives.html">The archives</a>, I would note, are rich here. Read up.)  I&#8217;m no longer going to write the Friday &#8220;Hack Education Weekly News,&#8221; my chronicle of all the education, technology, and ed-tech news of the week. I&#8217;m ending that project because I&#8217;m no longer going to write my lengthy series on the year-in-review either. Not in 2019 at least, as I have to focus on <em><a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a></em> (the draft is due in April and the final manuscript due in September). </p>

<p>Once the book is done, I plan to return to writing on this site and to publishing essays analyzing what&#8217;s happened and happening in education and technology. Many of these will be historical, since it seems that so many people who work in ed-tech are utterly ignorant (even purposefully ignorant) of the field&#8217;s rich (but troubling) history. Some of these will respond to the latest happenings, but I want the work I do here on Hack Education to be less reactive to the bad stuff that gets trotted out daily as &#8220;innovation.&#8221; I don&#8217;t want to have to read the ed-tech publications that make me so deeply sad about what&#8217;s being peddled and promoted and so deeply disappointed about people&#8217;s willingness to read and write and buy that crap. The way we get better and smarter will not be through these ed-tech&#8217;s marketers and hucksters. </p>

<p>I am hoping that the shift away from compiling all the goings-on for that weekly news round-up will give me more time to think deeply and critically about education and technology, instead of perpetually being enraged by how many terrible and silly things are marketed as &#8220;solutions&#8221; by folks who just want to sell a product or service &#8211; some aware, some unaware that their very well-funded load of futurist bullshit is pretty damn dystopian. </p>

<p>This site will remain vulture free. No investors, philanthropists, corporate sponsors, or advertisers. Just pigeons.</p>
