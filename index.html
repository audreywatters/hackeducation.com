            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>Some thoughts on the closure of the coding bootcamps Dev Bootcamp and The Iron Yard, owned by for-profit colleges Kaplan and Apollo Education Group respectively.

            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>As part of my Spencer Fellowship, I'm investigating the networks of investors and entrepreneurs shaping ed-tech policies and products. I've decided to focus on how "personalized learning" has come to dominate the narratives surrounding technology-based education reform. Spoiler alert: one of the organizations driving this is the Gates Foundation, which has spend some $15 billion on education grants since 1998....</p>

              <p>Neo-Nazis and white supremacists held a rally Friday night at the UVA campus, carrying torches and chanting "blood and soil." On Saturday, a counter-protester died when a white nationalist allegedly plowed his car into a crowd. Trump has refused to condemn this.
