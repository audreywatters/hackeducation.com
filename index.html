<p>I am an education writer, a recovering academic, a serial dropout, a rabble-rouser, and some days, ed-tech's Cassandra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; I often say. You can catch snippets of it, if you pay attention. I&rsquo;ve got a&nbsp;<a href="http://audreywatters.com/cv/cv.html">CV</a>&nbsp;if you&rsquo;re the type that cares about that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a lit geek and a beer snob. I love tattoos and, some days, I like technology. I loathe mushy foods and romantic comedies. I&rsquo;m not ashamed to admit I like ABBA and dislike Tolkien. I am somewhat ashamed to admit I&rsquo;ve not finished <em>Ulysses</em>. I prefer cake to pie, unless we're talking pastry projectiles. I pick fights on the Internet. I&rsquo;m a high school dropout and a PhD dropout. I have a Master's degree in Folklore and was once considered the academic expert on political pie-throwing. I was (I am?) a widow. I'm a mom. I have a cold hard stare that I like to imagine is much like Paddington Bear&rsquo;s and a smirk much like the Cheshire Cat&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I travel as much as I possibly can. &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; at least according to my driver&rsquo;s license, is Hermosa Beach, California.</p>
<p>Way back in junior high, I took an aptitude test that gave me a single career option:&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/108741250435676131889?rel=author">freelance writer</a>. &nbsp;I remember feeling rather panicky at the time, wondering how the hell I&rsquo;d manage to pull it off. But now I do.</p>
<p>My essays have appeared in multiple places, but mostly I write on my blog <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>. I've published a collection of my public talks, <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em>, and I'm in the middle of writing my next two books,<em> <a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a></em> and <em>Reclaim Your Domain</em>, both due out in 2015.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I read, rabble-rouse, drink beer, and prepare for the zombie apocalypse. Because you never know&hellip;</p>
<h2>About Hack Education</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/didak.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I created <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a> in June 2010 shortly after I became a technology journalist. I was frustrated by the lack of coverage of education technology -- by both technology and education publications. I did my day job (that is, the freelance writing I got paid for) but devoted as much attention as possible to Hack Education, trying to create the sort of publication that I'd want to read: one that's smart and snarky, one that's free of advertising and investor influence (See:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/disclosures/">Disclosures</a>), one that's tracking new technologies but not just because of some hyperbolic "revolution."</p>
<p>Hack Education isn't simple about how ed-tech changes "the system." It is about the future of learning. &nbsp;(Yes, there's a distinction there.)</p>
<p>To &ldquo;hack&rdquo; can mean a lot of things: To break in and break down. To cut to the core. &nbsp;To chop roughly. To be playful and clever. To be mediocre. To solve a problem, but to do so rather inelegantly. To pull systems apart. &nbsp;To "MacGyver" things back together. To re-code. To rebuild. To &ldquo;Hack Education,&rdquo; in turn, can have multiple interpretations, I recognize: a technological solution, a technology intrusion, a technological possibility, a technological disaster.</p>
<p>To "Hack Education" isn't something that just technologists should do or care about. Nor is this just a concern for teachers, administrators, parents, or students. We all should weigh the implications of technology on how we teach and learn.</p>
