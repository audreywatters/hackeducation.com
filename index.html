            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>An introduction to my annual series on the "Top Ed-Tech Trends" -- although I'm no longer going to refer to it that way. This is about the stories we tell and the stories we are told about the future of education and technology. It's a review of the recent past. Because no, things aren't changing faster than ever. Things are, however, getting pretty grim....</p>

              <p>It's book launch day! The latest book in "The Monsters of Education Technology" series is now available. Like the previous ones, it's a collection of the talks I gave throughout the year. It's also likely the <em>last</em> book in the "Monsters" series. (Don't read too much into that. Monster movies always end up doing sequels some day.)...</p>

              <p>It's the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, so there was slightly less news this week. Oh except for that big item the FCC announced on Wednesday, right as everyone was heading offline to celebrate: it's dismantling "net neutrality." That's bad news for the Internet, which is already such a corporate cesspool. But don't worry. I'm sure your favorite ed-tech company takes telecom money.</p>

              <p>There have been calls recently that education technology become a "discipline." It's a call that overlooks, no doubt, the number of degrees, conferences, publications, and job titles that already presume such a thing exists. But if, as some fear, ed-tech isn't disciplined enough, what are the implications for those of us on the margins?...</p>

              <p>This keynote was delivered at the ILTA's annual conference in Dublin. Here, I argue that we must care for our technological creations, lest they become monsters, that we must scrutinize "humbugs" and not merely dismiss them as entertainment, that we must reject technological End-Times rhetoric. And something about Sea Monkeys....</p>

              <p>2017 marks the eighth year in which I've reviewed the most important stories in the ed-tech industry from the previous twelve months. This isn't really a series about "trends," to be honest. It's not a list of products that schools should buy if they want to stay ahead of the innovative curve. Rather, it's a look at what we're told "innovation" will like....</p>
