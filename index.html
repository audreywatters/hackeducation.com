            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>Some thoughts on why the narrow definition of education technology - one touted by most education technologists - harms our ability to talk about infrastructure, history, practices, values. I riff on a recent story about the Department of Homeland Security and its development of a school shooting simulation program, as well as the history of metal detectors at urban schools. Folks try to insist neither are ed-tech. They're wrong....</p>

            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>This is a book review of Brian Dear's The Friendly Orange Glow, a history of PLATO. Dear has been working on this project for decades, and it shows. It is incredibly well-researched and this "untold history" is deservedly well-told. I use the book here to think about what's become "dogma" -- in computing and in ed-tech more generally....</p>

              <p>This is the eighth article in my end-of-year series. We've been warned again and again and again this year that "robots are coming for our jobs." Of course robots won't "take" our jobs. Robots are "coming" for anything. It's bosses who make the decision to automate labor in order to maximize their profits. That's not the fault of the school system. That's the problem with capitalism....</p>

              <p>This is the third article in my series on the stories that were told about education technology in 2017. This article examines the cost of college, the student loan debt crisis, and the business of financial aid. Normally one would talk about "the politics of financial aid." But under Trump it's much more obvious that those writing the policies and those telling the stories are literally in the business too....</p>
