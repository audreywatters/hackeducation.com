              <p>This is the transcript of my talk "at" a class at Illinois State University (via Zoom, of course). The class is on critical approaches to ed-tech, and I tried to demonstrate in my brief remarks how one might "read" a book from the Eighties about the future of learning with a critical gaze.</p>

              <p>This is the transcript of my talk "at" a class at Brandeis University (via Zoom, of course). The class is on critical race studies, and I wanted to talk a bit about how education and technology both draw heavily on white supremacy, particularly with regards to algorithms, surveillance, and labor.</p>

              <p>This is the transcript of my keynote at the Digital Pedagogy Lab. Except not really. It was a "flipped" keynote, so this is more like the pre-reading for what I actually talked about. Sort of. I ended up talking about my dog. But it's funny (not funny) how much ed-tech and dog obedience have in common.</p>

              <p>This talk was part of a webinar hosted by Contact North. I admit, it is less about 'building' than it is about 'dismantling.' And dare I say, once we dismantle surveillance tech, I am less interested in building more, alternative tech. I want to talk about the underlying culture that demands this control in the first place.</p>

              <p>Here. I have chronicled for you a decade of ed-tech failures and fuck-ups and flawed ideas. Oh yes, I’m sure you can come up with some rousing successes and some triumphant moments that made you thrilled about the 2010s and that give you hope for “the future of education.” Good for you. But that’s not my job. (And honestly, it’s probably not your job either.) .</p>

              <p>A book review of Shoshana Zuboff&#8217;s <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em>, a book that was long and rather melodramatic but that makes an argument that those in education technology need to pay attention to: these technologies curtail &#8220;the right to the future tense.&#8221;</p>

                <p>This talk was delivered at OEB 2019 in Berlin. I wanted to call out the misinformation and disinformation repeated by those who get on stage at ed-tech events (as well as those who uncritically accept the fairy tales as truth). If we prance delightedly towards a dystopian ed-tech future, it is in part because of the storytellers in ed-tech who peddle this bullshit.</p>
