              <p>This talk was delivered at MIT for Justin Reich's Comparative Media Studies class "Learning, Media, and Technology." As the opening weeks of the class address histories and theories of learning, I wanted to underscore how things (ideologies, really) get hard-coded into practices and products. I can't believe I gave a talk on SCORM....</p>

              <p>A response to this weekend's story in The New York Times on "brand ambassadors" and the ethics of education technology marketing. I'm particularly interested in how the teachers featured (and more broadly ed-tech celebrity in general) reflects whiteness and affluence. Who gets to be an "influencer" and why, and to what end?...</p>

              <p>The Department of Education's inspector general has labeled Western Governors University a "correspondence course," indicating that the school now owes the federal government a $700 million reimbursement for financial aid. That's a potentially devastating fine, and most are skeptical that the Department of Education will follow through. Competency-based education is, after all, a favorite tool of reformers....</p>

            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>There have been calls recently that education technology become a "discipline." It's a call that overlooks, no doubt, the number of degrees, conferences, publications, and job titles that already presume such a thing exists. But if, as some fear, ed-tech isn't disciplined enough, what are the implications for those of us on the margins?...</p>

              <p>This talk was delivered at The University of Edinburgh.

What sort of future is one where the model for learning is "the driverless university"?...</p>

(We can hope, I'd argue, that it will not be, not just because it's a bad idea practically but because it's a dangerous one politically.)...</p>
