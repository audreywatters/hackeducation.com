              <p>This talk was presented at a technology workshop titled &#8220;Tech4Good,&#8221; a small gathering of technologists who &#8211; as the name suggests &#8211; would like to address some of the problems society faces today. I think you can imagine my skepticism, no doubt, and my concerns.</p>

              <p>Hack Education turns 8 today. I mean, I bought the domain a week or so before, but today in 2010 was the day I finally installed WordPress and hit "publish." Man, so much has changed since then. I don't run on WordPress for starters. I run on this little indie company's architecture. GitHub? Maybe you've heard of them? Sigh....</p>

              <p>This talk was delivered at an event at CUNY on "The Labor of Open" -- a gathering of librarians talking about an open education and open publishing initiative at the university. I wanted to talk about how we imagine a technological future of labor and whose work (and what kind of work) is not seen in that framework....</p>

              <p>This is the transcript from the talk I gave at the CUNY Graduate Center. I'm not sure why I agreed to give a talk as I am so swamped with end-of-semester work. I thought initially I'd just talk through the sample chapter I wrote. Instead I revised a previous talk a little and added some of my book-related research....</p>

              <p>This is a book review of Brian Dear's The Friendly Orange Glow, a history of PLATO. Dear has been working on this project for decades, and it shows. It is incredibly well-researched and this "untold history" is deservedly well-told. I use the book here to think about what's become "dogma" -- in computing and in ed-tech more generally....</p>

              <p>This was the tenth article in my "end of 2018" series. This one looks at "brain-based education" and "social emotional learning" and other plans for corporate, cognitive education policy. It's the new behaviorism. I'm not Skinner would like the emphasis on emotions. But he'd love it that we're giving up on the quaint idea of "free will."...</p>

              <p>This talk was delivered at the NMC Summer 2017 conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

              <p>2017 marked the eighth year in which I reviewed the most important stories in the ed-tech industry from the previous twelve months. This isn't really a series about "trends," to be honest. It's not a list of products that schools should buy if they want to stay ahead of the innovative curve. Rather, it's a look at what we're told "innovation" will like....</p>
