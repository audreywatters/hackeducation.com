              <p>It's book launch day! The latest book in "The Monsters of Education Technology" series is now available.

Monster movies always end up doing sequels some day.)...</p>

              <p>Ivanka Trump penned an op-ed in The New York Post last week, arguing "Why we need to start teaching tech in Kindergarten." She's indicated she plans to make ed-tech a focus of her time in the White House. Inside Higher Ed asked some "experts" their thoughts. Mine didn't make it past the editor, so here they are....</p>
