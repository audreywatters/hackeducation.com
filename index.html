            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>This is the fifth article in my end-of-year series in which I try so very hard to explain why I resist the narrative that education technology will save us. Indeed, in a world of Trump and Trumpism, education technology exposes us to more risk through the collection of data, the analysis of data, the weaponization of data...</p>

              <p>This is the fourth article in my end-of-year series on the stories that were told about education technology in 2017. Venture capitalists have been telling stories about the potential of technology platforms for quite some time. What happens to education (and what happens to democracy) in a platform economy?...</p>

              <p>This is the third article in my series on the stories that were told about education technology in 2017. This article examines the cost of college, the student loan debt crisis, and the business of financial aid. Normally one would talk about "the politics of financial aid." But under Trump it's much more obvious that those writing the policies and those telling the stories are literally in the business too....</p>

              <p>This is the second article in my annual review of all things ed-tech. This is a sweeping look at the politics and policies of Betsy DeVos, Mitch Daniels, Jerry Falwell Jr, and others -- how religion and evangelism have shaped education technology this year. Silicon Valley pushes apocalypticism too. Education is caught in its prophesies....</p>

              <p>There have been calls recently that education technology become a "discipline." It's a call that overlooks, no doubt, the number of degrees, conferences, publications, and job titles that already presume such a thing exists. But if, as some fear, ed-tech isn't disciplined enough, what are the implications for those of us on the margins?...</p>

              <p>This keynote was delivered at the ILTA's annual conference in Dublin.

And something about Sea Monkeys....</p>
