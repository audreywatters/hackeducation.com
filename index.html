            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>We're halfway through 2017, so I've made some calculations about what ed-tech investment looks like so far this year.

            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>This talk was delivered virtually to a class at Teachers College, Columbia University. I was asked to speak about learning analytics. And I did, if you pay attention. Mostly, I talked about the history of tracking steps as a signal for health. This sort of counting has a history, a technical and pseudo-scientific one....</p>

              <p>Lots of education news this week, in part because of a couple of very important Supreme Court rulings: one involving Trump's travel ban and one involving taxpayer funding of religious schools.

              <p>Virtual reality is not new. What's being sold to schools right now as VR is perhaps not even virtual reality. Rather it's stereoscopy with a more expensive device.

              <p>This talk was delivered at the NMC Summer 2017 conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
