            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>Some thoughts on why the narrow definition of education technology - one touted by most education technologists - harms our ability to talk about infrastructure, history, practices, values. I riff on a recent story about the Department of Homeland Security and its development of a school shooting simulation program, as well as the history of metal detectors at urban schools. Folks try to insist neither are ed-tech. They're wrong....</p>

            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>This is a book review of Brian Dear's The Friendly Orange Glow, a history of PLATO. Dear has been working on this project for decades, and it shows. It is incredibly well-researched and this "untold history" is deservedly well-told. I use the book here to think about what's become "dogma" -- in computing and in ed-tech more generally....</p>

            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>Often, when people talk about "personalized learning," they emphasize the use of technology. But "programmed instruction" isn't simply about teaching machines. This is the history of the SRA cards, reading kits developed in the 1950s (and still popular in the 1970s during my early school years) that purported to "personalize" language and literature instruction....</p>

I cannot believe that in the midst of everything I'm trying to accomplish right now I agreed to give a talk. But I did. There's not much new here. After all, I am pounding out so many other words in other stories. Who listens to any of it, I guess, when the billionaires tell and sell better tales....</p>

              <p>2017 marks the eighth year in which I've reviewed the most important stories in the ed-tech industry from the previous twelve months. This isn't really a series about "trends," to be honest. It's not a list of products that schools should buy if they want to stay ahead of the innovative curve. Rather, it's a look at what we're told "innovation" will like....</p>
