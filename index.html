              <p>Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education are going to screw over public schools in so many ways. They're going to cut budgets. There are rumors they're going to eliminate the public service loan forgiveness program. But remember: student loan issues aren't ed-tech, so let's pretend like none of this is happening....</p>
