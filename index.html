              <p>This talk was delivered at MIT for Justin Reich's Comparative Media Studies class "Learning, Media, and Technology." As the opening weeks of the class address histories and theories of learning, I wanted to underscore how things (ideologies, really) get hard-coded into practices and products. I can't believe I gave a talk on SCORM....</p>

              <p>A response to this weekend's story in The New York Times on "brand ambassadors" and the ethics of education technology marketing. I'm particularly interested in how the teachers featured (and more broadly ed-tech celebrity in general) reflects whiteness and affluence. Who gets to be an "influencer" and why, and to what end?...</p>

              <p><em>The Matrix</em> portrays a dystopian future where intelligent machines have subdued and enslaved the human population, but the film's display of learning technologies -- information transferred directly and instantly into the brain -- is the sort of thing frequently hailed as a worthy scientific goal: learning that is efficient, scalable, standardized, and fully automated.</p>
