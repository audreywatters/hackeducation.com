<h2>Support Hack Education</h2>
<br />
<p>For the past decade, I have kept this site advertising-free and sponsor-free and venture capitalism-free. I do not track my readership through web analytics. Publishing online has become deeply intertwined with the kinds of surveillance capitalism that I am opposed to.</p>

<p>For many years, I relied on the donations of readers to keep this site active. But as my attention turns to writing books and longer form magazine articles, I am not sure how much writing will appear here. I am no longer operating a Patreon account or offering recurring donations via PayPal.</p>

<p>I am very grateful for those who have supported me financially over the years. You can continue to support my work by buying my books or hiring me to speak at your school or event. And, of course, you can still read my stuff and then tell everyone working in education and/or technology about how fucking insightful I have always been.</p>
